My original reaction set for Facebook was 155 kB and after optimizing them, I got it to just 35 kB!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nLet\u2019s begin with the obvious,\\n\\n## Import images into your React source code\\n\\nThe first quick win is to always import your images in your source code.\\n\\nAdd the images into the src directory. For me, I created a folder called img inside the src folder and put all the image assets inside.\\n\\nNow from your component files, just type in\\n\\n```js\\nimport like from \'../img/src/like.png\'\\n```\\n\\nYou can insert this image in the src attribute in the img tag like this:\\n\\n```js\\n<img src={like} alt=\\"like icon\\" />\\n```\\n\\nWhen you import images this way, create-react-app (or webpack) will bundle all your images and try to best compress them.\\n\\n:::warning Note\\n\\nDon\u2019t put your images in the `/public` directory and hotlink them, unless you have a strong reason to do so (Hadar, 2021).\\n:::\\n\\nIf your images are less than 10 kB (10,000 bytes) these images will be converted into inline base 64 strings. So they will load instantly (Llobera, 2020).\\n\\nSee this love icon is 4.5 kB (less than 10 kB) and converted as a data URL:\\n\\n![images converted to data url](./images/1.png)\\n\\nBut when your images are over 10 KB, for example, this care reaction icon is 14 kB, react will link to the asset file.\\n\\n![source image](./images/2.png)\\n\\nDid you know about the inline image thing? I didn\u2019t. Tweet this to your followers,\\n\\n:::tip\\nIf your image is under 10 kB, Create React App will turn them into base64 data strings, making them load instantly!\\n:::\\n\\nTo further compress these source images, we have to optimize them ourselves,\\n\\n## Compress Your Source Images Using TinyPNG\\n\\nTinyPNG is an online tool I use to compress images. Usually optimized PNG and JPGs have a small file size already, but when I run these images against this free tool, I get surprised that it squeezes up even more.\\n\\n![tiny png](./images/3.jpg)\\n\\nI saw a 68% savings when compressing my reaction icon pngs using TinyPNG.\\n\\nCompressed JPG and PNGs can only take you so far. If you want to really up your compression game, you need to find an even better image format: webp and avif.\\n\\n## Use Webp/Avif Images for Even Better Compression\\n\\nWebp (weppy) is a new fast image format developed by Google. If weppy is fast, then AVIF is faster. In my ReactionPoll tool, I used weppy images to further compress my images.\\n\\n![webp image converter](./images/4.png)\\n\\nWhat I did was to replace all images with their webp counterparts.\\n\\nThere is a weppy converter tool called cwebp that I downloaded and installed into my computer, but I was too lazy to compress them in CLI. So I used an online converter to convert my existing PNG files to webp.\\n\\nThe weppy versions helped cut down around 20% more file sizes from my already compressed PNG files.\\n\\nYou should keep in mind that, weppy and avif are newer file formats and not available in older browsers. It\u2019s a good idea to serve webp but also fall back to the jpg/pngs.\\n\\n## Use Webp and PNG together with Fallbacks\\n\\nUsing the `<picture>` tag we can add both webp and png files. The browser will pick the image that it supports.\\n\\nThe tag looks like this:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport likePng from \'../img/src/like.png\'\\nimport likeWebp from \'../img/src/like.webp\'\\n;<picture>\\n  <source srcSet={likeWebp} type=\\"image/webp\\" />\\n  <img src={likePng} alt=\\"like button\\" />\\n</picture>\\n```\\n\\nI learned how to use this trick + how to use a reusable react component to automate the process using Josh\u2019s blog post.\\n\\nBasically what he did was create a component called `ImgWithFallback`\\n\\n```jsx\\nconst ImgWithFallback = ({\\n  src,\\n  fallback,\\n  type = \'image/webp\',\\n  ...delegated\\n}) => {\\n  return (\\n    <picture>\\n      <source srcSet={src} type={type} />\\n      <img src={fallback} {...delegated} />\\n    </picture>\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis component will take the webp image as the src and the png as the fallback image.\\n\\nUse webp/avif images for faster loading but also have a fallback to png/jpeg files using a `<picture>` tag.\\n\\nAfter adding the WEBPs, I can say my images are loading much quicker than PNGs.\\n\\n## My Results\\n\\nI started with original reaction icons that I downloaded from the internet. After resizing all the icons into 250\xd7250 png images, the total file size for the seven icons was 155 kB.\\n\\n![compression results](./images/5.png)\\n\\nAfter compressing the PNGs with TinyPNG service, I ended up with 50 kB file size for all of them.\\n\\nFinally, when I converted them to webp file format, I ended up with 35 kB file size, that leaves 5 kB per image icon.\\n\\nNow you must be looking at the picture above and thinking, why the weppy images look pixelated? I don\u2019t know why it is displaying like this on my computer, but when I open both icons side by side, I can say they look fine,\\n\\n![side by side comparison](./images/6.jpg)\\n\\nBy the way, all these icons you see are part of my Linkedin and Facebook reaction poll generator. If you want to check out my project in action and how the images perform, visit ReactionPoll.com/facebook\\n\\n## Final Thoughts\\n\\nImage compression and performance optimization is ongoing thing. As time goes, we will surely find out more ways to shave off those extra kilobytes without compromising the quality. When that happens, I will update this article with newer tricks as I learn them.\\n\\nTill then start optimizing your react website and send me a tweet if you found this post useful.\\n\\n**To recap what we learned so far:**\\n\\n- Always import your images in reactjs\\n- Compress your assets using a tool like TinyPNG (it also works with jpegs)\\n- Use webp and avif image formats for fast loading but also have fallbacks for the browsers that don\u2019t support them\\n\\n## References\\n\\n1.

I can tell you put a lot of effort and thoughts into writing this blog post. I really like the flow of the entire post. The use of screenshots and images are really helping you to tell your story. To me, as a reader, I do not feel exhausted reading through it and I even get some surprises like the \u201ctweet\u201d option for me to easily tweet what I have learned from your blog post to others. Fast and convenient! More importantly, I really like the \u201ctable of contents\u201d and the recaps at the end of the blog post.\\n\\nHere are some of my opinions and suggestions that hopefully can help you out to improve the current blog post (I am just writing down what I hope to see as a reader when reading through the blog post):\\n\\n(1) The \u201cCare Reaction\u201d icon compression results in using TinyPNG and Webp methods \u2013 I know you have displayed screenshots regarding the file size of the care reaction before compression. I think it would be helpful to see this throughout all the other sections to see the progression of the compression. It gives readers more excitement when they are able to see the result immediately after reading sections 2 and 3.\\n\\n(2) Included the \u201cCan I use\u201d link for Webp and AVIF \u2013 ie, [can i use](https://caniuse.com/?search=webP%20image%20format) so the reader can click on the link and directly see the browser compatibility of these two image types.\\n\\n(3) For Josh\u2019s blog post, I think it would be best if you could just link directly to the [\u201cAbstraction with React\u201d](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/performance/embracing-modern-image-formats/#abstraction-with-react). As a reader, I do not need to scroll all the way down to the source code.\\n\\nThe above items are just my opinions and hopefully, they can be slightly helpful to you if you are looking for optimization.\\n\\nBy the way, I have found a small typo in section 3 the last paragraph right after the bold text, you have Webp spelled incorrectly.\\n\\nOverall, I really enjoy reading this post and learning something new regarding image compression! Great post, Tamal!\\n\\n> Tamal: Hey Cindy, thank you for a very thoughtful comment.\\n>\\n> Let me write some quick responses to your points below:\\n>\\n> 1.  You are right. Gonna update with some more before/after screenshots.\\n> 2.  Good idea! I am gonna put them.\\n> 3.  Sure, will add the direct link.\\n>     Typo: I intentionally wrote Weppy -it\u2019s like a human-friendly >name of the technical WebP.\\n\\n**Jose Oropeza**: Excellent article Tamal. I honestly never considered image compression but will surely give this a try on a future project, specially since image quality is not compromised. Would love to see an article on best practices for optimizing gifs.\\n\\n> Tamal: Definitely! Google web dev recommends web video in place of gifs to save data. But I\u2019ll def look into it.\\n\\n**Christiaan:** So if I understand it correctly all images below 10k are in lined. So in the last step both the PNG and webp are in lined.\\nSo aren\u2019t you shipping 35Kb more in the last example?\\n\\n> Tamal: Only pngs are getting inlined, so in the last step, I am keeping both webp and png because of backwards compatibility."},{"id":"google-analytics-with-reactjs","metadata":{"permalink":"/tamalwebsite/google-analytics-with-reactjs","editUrl":"https://github.com/tamalweb/tamalwebsite/tree/master/blog/2021/11-19-google-analytics-with-reactjs/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021/11-19-google-analytics-with-reactjs/index.md","title":"How to Add the New Google Analytics 4 in Reactjs App","description":"You probably know about the react-ga npm package but the sad news is, it does not work with the latest Google Analytics 4 version.

I am putting this as the last item of the head tag, after the site title.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/8.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nBuild your project and publish. For me, I have set up my project in Netlify with GitHub CI. So every time I push the changes to my Github main branch, it will be deployed automatically.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow visit your website from your browser or mobile device and verify that Google Analytics is registering the views. If you can see the views, that means you have successfully set up your analytics with the React app.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/9.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## How To Track Custom Events in Reactjs App?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to track custom events you can use this npm package [ga-gtag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ga-gtag) which integrates Google Analytics 4 with your Reactjs application.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently I created a [poll maker app](https://reactionpoll.com/) and I wanted to know how many people downloaded the polls using my app.\\r\\n\\r\\nGA custom events come in handy for this type of tracking. [Learn more about custom events from GA website](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/events).\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\ngtag(\'event\', \'download_poll_image\', {\\r\\n  poll_title: \'some value\',\\r\\n})\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously we added the GA script tag into the head section of our index.html file, but we can\u2019t use gtag inside our JS file because it\u2019s not defined. This is where this handy package comes in.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust install the package using npm install ga-gtag and import it into your project file where you will be tracking the event.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nimport gtag from \'ga-gtag\'\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNow since I want to track the image downloads, I will add this custom method inside my image download function.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is how the gtag event function looks like:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nfunction trackDownloadEvent() {\\r\\n  gtag(\'event\', \'download_poll_image\', {\\r\\n    poll_title: \'some title\',\\r\\n  })\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nSee I have named the event `download_poll_image` and inside I am tracking the `poll_title` parameter. This way, I will know how many times a new image has been downloaded and what were the titles of the polls that are generated.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/10.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip Side note\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I used this package to install the gtag instead of pasting the script tag, I was not receiving any data for new users. That\u2019s why I decided to manually copy-paste the script tag and use this package just for tracking custom events.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## How to See the Custom Even Parameters in GA Dashboard?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne issue I ran into was, the custom event parameters don\u2019t get saved in Google Analytics 4. So I can see all the `download_poll_image` events, but not the individual poll titles. I did some Googling and found that it will only show up on the real-time pane (not good).\\r\\n\\r\\nSo to make GA save these parameters, you have to mark that event as a conversion for it to store all the parameters you want:\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/11.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Analytics will keep them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have come to the end of this post and it helped you with setting up Google Analytics with your React app, then please let me know by tweeting about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt tells me that I have done a good job and will inspire me to share more cool stuff in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Key Takaways:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Add Google Analytics tag simply by pasting into the head section of index.html page.\\r\\n- The react-ga npm package still doesn\u2019t work with the new `G-XXXXX` tags.\\r\\n- Use gtag npm package to track custom events.\\r\\n- To persist the custom event parameters, you have to instruct GA."},{"id":"null-javascript","metadata":{"permalink":"/tamalwebsite/null-javascript","editUrl":"https://github.com/tamalweb/tamalwebsite/tree/master/blog/2020/3-19-null-javascript/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2020/3-19-null-javascript/index.md","title":"What is null in JavaScript?","description":"Every programming language has at least one bottom value but JavaScript has two: null and undefined (Crockford, 2017).

We are going to focus on null for this article because there is so much that\u2019s going on behind the scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\n![null js](./images/featured.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is null in JavaScript? **null means no-value. When there is no value assigned to an object variable, it means the object doesn\u2019t exist. If you want to delete the contents of an object from memory, you would assign that object to null.**\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the way, null is not exclusive to just JavaScript, I have seen it on Java, C#, SQL and it works the same way it does in JavaScript.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nAn object is a combination of primitive values like string, number, and boolean types. Since objects are special types of data, we also need a special concept of assigning no-values. This is where null comes in.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this article, I will tell all about the null type and how it works in JavaScript and programming in general. But before I can fully explain to you about the null type, let me give you an overview of the types in JavaScript.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Primitive Types and Reference Types\\r\\n\\r\\nA primitive type of data is a number and boolean. In JavaScript, the string data type is also considered a primitive type (spoilers: it\u2019s actually not). This is because a string \u201cHello World\u201d is actually a string of characters: \u2018H\u2019, \u2018e\u2019, \u2018l\u2019, \u2018l\u2019, \u2018o\u2019\u2026 and so on. A single character \u2018T\u2019 is a primitive type and the string is like an array of all these characters together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is why In Java (which is different than JavaScript), the String data type is actually an object. The same thing applies to JavaScript but JS is built in such a way that the string type is treated like primitive values.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo in short, it\u2019s safe to say these are primitives in JavaScript: string, number, boolean.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nvar name = \'Tamal\'\\r\\nvar age = 100\\r\\nvar isMale = true\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### So what are primitive types?\\r\\n\\r\\nA primitive type is where the variable actually holds the data.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I open the variable age, I will find the exact value there.\\r\\n\\r\\n`age shows 100`\\r\\nBut watch what happens when I do the same for objects.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nvar person = {\\r\\n  name: \'Tamal\',\\r\\n  age: 100,\\r\\n  isMale: true,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I open the variable person, I will see this memory address and not the actual data.\\r\\n\\r\\n`person shows 0x000001`\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is where primitive types and reference types differ.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I mentioned earlier, an object is a custom data type made out of multiple primitive data types or even other objects.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn array is a collection of other primitive types like a list of names, or a list of numbers. So it\u2019s an object too. When you check the type of an array, you will see object:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nvar list = [1, 2, 3]\\r\\ntypeof list\\r\\n// \'object\'\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nSince each of the object is a custom type, a variable space is not enough to hold all the items and the configuration in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solution: references.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe data items will be stored somewhere in the computer memory and the variable will only store the address to that memory location.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis variable will only reference to that memory location, thus it\u2019s called a reference type (Sierra & Berts, 2005).\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how this all relate to the null type?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that we know there are two types in JavaScript, we can set the initial starting values of the primitive types like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nvar name = \'\'\\r\\nvar age = 0\\r\\nvar isMale = false\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when it comes to objects, we can\u2019t simply say person = {} because an empty object literal is still taking up memory somewhere and it\u2019s not truly empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo fully erase the object from the memory, we will have to assign null to that object. But before you do that, let me tell you why doing this matters.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Referencing a Reference type Variable\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the value of a primitive type lives inside the variable, it\u2019s very easy to copy a variable.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nvar hero = \'Superman\'\\r\\nvar memberName = hero\\r\\n// change the value\\r\\nmemberName = \'Batman\'\\r\\n// Check them:\\r\\n\\r\\n// hero\\r\\n// >> \\"Superman\\"\\r\\n// memberName\\r\\n// >> \\"Batman\\"\\r\\n// But we can\u2019t do the same thing with reference types.\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we try to do this and make changes to the second object, you will notice that the original object is also changing.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nvar person = {\\r\\nname: \\"Tamal\\",\\r\\nlanguage: \\"JavaScript\\"\\r\\n}\\r\\n\u200b\\r\\nvar member = person;\\r\\n// Now both objects have the same contents\\r\\n// And they are referencing to the same object\\r\\n\u200b\\r\\n// Making changes:\\r\\nmember.name = \\"Karen\\";\\r\\nmember.language = \\"C#\\";\\r\\n\u200b\\r\\nperson\\r\\n\\r\\n// {name: \\"Karen\\", language: \\"C#\\"}\\r\\n// member\\r\\n// {name: \\"Karen\\", language: \\"C#\\"}\\r\\n// So you can see two variables are referencing the same object.\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is why it\u2019s important to know that the variable is actually holding the reference to the object. When you copy this variable, only the reference is being copied.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not going to cover how to copy objects because we are interested in the null value and how it comes into play.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Garbage Collection\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these variables take up some space in memory and there must be some way to free up the memory by doing some cleanups. When you are done with some objects, you can feel free to clean up that object so that the memory can be used for other things.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn high-level languages like in JavaScript, you don\u2019t have to worry about this garbage collection, it happens automatically when the program stops using the variables (Sierra & Berts, 2005).\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will notice that you can create an object in JavaScript but can\u2019t delete it.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nvar person = {}\\r\\n// there is no delete option\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nBut you can with the null value.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you assign null to a variable it will unlink the reference to the memory.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nperson = null\\r\\n// the object is deleted forever\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe JavaScript (and Java) garbage collector is set up in such a way that whenever it finds an object that is not being referenced by any other variables, it will delete it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo in a nutshell, the null value is used whenever you want to completely delete an object from the memory, and make sure no other variable is referencing that object.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that you know what null is and how it\u2019s used, let me outline some interesting things about the null value in JavaScript.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Why typeof null is object?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you check the type of null, you will see it\u2019s an object. But null is not an object, it\u2019s a primitive value. This is a bug in JavaScript and can\u2019t be fixed (Crockford, 2017). On the other hand, null is only used for objects in JavaScript, so it\u2019s useful if you adapt your program according to it.\\r\\n\\r\\ntypeof null\\r\\n\\r\\n// \\"object\\"\\r\\n// // this is a bug in JavaScript\\r\\n\\r\\n### Is null and undefined the same in JavaScript?\\r\\n\\r\\nnull and undefined are not the same because null is a lack of value and undefined means the variable is not been assigned.

In this article, I will talk a little about Node and the concepts that go around this runtime environment. So to answer your question in simple terms,\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is Node JS? **Node JS is a runtime environment for the JavaScript language similar to how you would use a Python interpreter to run Python code on your computer. Node JS is being used to run and execute JavaScript code in the server to build backend services.**\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the official Node JS website, _\u201cNode.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser\u201d_ (Node.js org, 2020).\\r\\n\\r\\nRight out of the bat you must have figured it out what open-source and cross-platform means.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n**Open-source** means the source code of Node JS is open to the public (like Linux) and everyone can contribute, modify and use this software without paying any license fee. So if you make an application with Node JS, you won\u2019t have to pay any money for the core Node JS runtime.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Cross-platform** means Node JS can run in all the major operating systems like Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and others so it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of computer you own, it will still run. You can host a Node JS application in both Linux or Windows servers for deployment.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that the obvious is out of the way, I am going to explain the other important parts to help you understand what the Node runtime environment is and why you should care to use it. As part of the explanation, I am also going to outline other technical aspects of the runtime like the asynchronous, event-driven and non-blocking aspect of Node JS.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What is the Node JS runtime environment?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs mentioned before, Node JS is a runtime environment that will execute JavaScript code, but why is it so special?\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the invention of Node JS, JavaScript language was only confined to the browser like in Google Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. Before Node, we could only run JavaScript in the browser to do little interactions and effects. It didn\u2019t have any way to access the file system and that\u2019s one reason why we don\u2019t have any print command in JavaScript.\\r\\n\\r\\nNode JS took the V8 engine (the JavaScript engine of Google Chrome) and turned that into a standalone JavaScript execution environment on the desktop.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo in a nutshell, the Node JS runtime environment allows you to run and execute JavaScript code outside of the browser environment. It allowed JS to read and write files and talk to the internet independently. This gave the opportunity to make web servers with Node JS and currently it\u2019s a popular choice for making full-stack applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nJavaScript language brought many new advantages to backend development with its new runtime environment. Here let me outline some of the technical features of the Node runtime environment that makes it different than others.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Asynchronous\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIn a synchronous programming model, things happen one at a time\u201d (Eloquent JavaScript, 2020, para. 4). Compared to that, in an Asynchronous model, multiple things can happen at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nNode JS has one single thread to deal with the requests and another one as the main working thread.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a user requests something, Node JS will send that request to the thread and get back to the main worker thread. If another user does another request, it will put the next request to the same thread and get back to working again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some time, the request will return and Node will be notified. Node will then take the response and give it to the user.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this process can happen in one single thread one after another and this the gist of asynchronousness in Node JS.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other programming environments such as Python and PHP, when someone makes a request, the entire thread gets blocked. If another user needs to make a new request, the system will have to create a new thread for the operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNode JS works with a single thread and can get notified for fulfilled requests via events. Let me explain what it means what event-driven means in Node JS.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Event-driven\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Node JS is sending the request to another thread for completion, it has to know how something returns to it. Node JS will always keep listening to various events. This is similar to how operating systems work. An operating system will listen for various events like a mouse click, keyboard key press and so on. When an event comes, the system will stop what it was doing and put its attention to the event at hand and do what is required.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly, in Node JS, it can do the assign tasks and still keep listening to other events. When a user clicks or something has returned from the thread, it will do what\u2019s needed to do. This event-driven mechanism is what makes it possible for Node to work with a single thread and be super fast.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Non-blocking\\r\\n\\r\\nNode JS does not sleep because it can do things one after another. It\u2019s sort of like juggling where one item is always in the air. In Node\u2019s case, it will juggle with one hand and keep all the other things in the air (other thread.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you make a request to save something to the database, you know it\u2019s going to take some time to write. Node is going to move on to the next task at hand. This is the basics of JavaScript\u2019s non-blocking computation model.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you write this command in python: `sleep(5)`\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s going to literally sleep for five seconds and won\u2019t be available to do anything within this time. This is an example of a blocking code. If you are making a server were 10,000s of users are making requests, this means for five seconds the server will not be able to serve these people.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne the other hand, this is an equivalent code in Node: setTimeout(doSomething, 5000);\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Node will do that function after five seconds, but it will never go to sleep. This way it will still be able to handle all the other requests that come to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Node Package Manager, NPM\\r\\n\\r\\nNode JS works with packages similar to how Java and Python has their own packages. NPM is a public repository where all the developers can contribute packages.\\r\\n\\r\\nNPM comes built-in with Node JS and when you are building applications, you are going to use NPM commands to install and work with packages.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this you will have to enter Linux like commands for installing various packages like this is how you would install the express js framework:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nnpm install express\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Next steps\\r\\n\\r\\n- Download Node JS and start using it\\r\\n- Start building something with it\\r\\n- Leave a comment in this post and let me know what you think\\r\\n\\r\\n## References:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

You have learned about Node JS and would like to dive in to become a backend developer. Since you asked, this means you don\u2019t know JS or have little experience with it. Allow me to simplify this for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould I learn JavaScript before Node JS? **If you have taken another programming course before (like Python) then you have the proper programming foundation and can go ahead and start learning Node JS without taking a JavaScript course. You can pick up the fundamentals of JS while you build servers with Node. However, if this is the first time you are programming, then I would highly recommend you take a foundation web development course in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get your ABCs down.**\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nOther than general programming syntax in JavaScript, there is so much that goes into Node JS. When you are learning Node JS, you are most probably interested in learning how to build the backend services or the REST API of a website. For the rest of this article, I will discuss various programming and JavaScript concepts that go into when working with Node JS. You can check these skills and see if you already have these covered so you can make the right decision whether if you should learn JavaScript before Node or not.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Programming fundamentals to master before learning Node JS\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are some of the barebone programming fundamentals that every programmer must learn and master before they can take on building anything with code. These concepts are not exclusive to JavaScript and you will notice that you already know these if you have taken a programming course in another language such as Python, Ruby, PHP or Java.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Basic data types\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are your basic building blocks like strings, integers, and boolean data types. In programming, these are called primitive data types. You should be able to identify each of these data types and be able to assign them to variables. JavaScript has only a few primitive data types and they are String, Numbers (integers and floats) and boolean. In Node JS we make lots of variables and work with all sorts of data types throughout the application.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// Primitive data types in JavaScript\\r\\nconst name = \'Tamal\' // String\\r\\nconst age = 100 // Number\\r\\nconst isAwesome = true // Boolean\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Control flow\\r\\n\\r\\nIn programming, if, else and else if are what makes the programs versatile. With the basic control flow structure, we make Node JS apps do various tasks depending on various conditions. Depending on the condition we can execute a command or do something else entirely.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// Control flow\\r\\nif (isAwesome) {\\r\\n  console.log(\'Tamal is awesome!\')\\r\\n} else {\\r\\n  console.log(\'Ouch!\')\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nOther than if/else, Node JS also makes extensive use of the switch statement in various cases. So as a programmer you should know your control flow structure to excel in Node.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// Switch statement\\r\\nswitch (color) {\\r\\n  case \'RED\':\\r\\n    console.log(\'Stop\')\\r\\n    break\\r\\n  case \'GREEN\':\\r\\n    console.log(\'GO\')\\r\\n    break\\r\\n  case \'YELLOW\':\\r\\n    console.log(\'WAIT\')\\r\\n    break\\r\\n  default:\\r\\n    console.log(\'DO NOTHING\')\\r\\n    break\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Loops\\r\\n\\r\\nLoops like the for-loop, while-loop is what helps make repeating tasks in Node JS. Often times we use loops in a helper utility function. Other times we may use it to do a server action n number of times. As a programmer, you should know your loops really well to start learning Node JS.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// For loop\\r\\nfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\\r\\n  console.log(\'I love you!\')\\r\\n}\\r\\n// We used let instead of const because\\r\\n// we have to keep assigning a new number\\r\\n// to the i variable\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// While loop\\r\\nlet i = 0\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile (i < 10) {\\r\\n  console.log(\'I hate you!\')\\r\\n  i++\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// Do while loop\\r\\nlet i = 0;\\r\\n\u200b\\r\\ndo {\\r\\nconsole.log(\\"Are we there yet?\\");\\r\\ni++;\\r\\n} while (i < 10);\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Functions\\r\\n\\r\\nFunctions (subroutines or methods) are what Node JS servers are made of. In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, which means in JS, functions can take another function as a parameter or can return a new function as output. You should be able to build useful modular functions that can do a set of small tasks to return a value. In Node JS, everything is made out of little functions including the routes, APIs and middlewares.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// Functions\\r\\nfunction sumOfTwoNumbers(a, b) {\\r\\n  let result = a + b\\r\\n  return result\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nsumOfTwoNumbers(2, 3) // 5\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Advance data types, Objects, and Arrays\\r\\n\\r\\nObjects are heavily used in modern JavaScript and in Node JS, objects are used everywhere. You should have a good idea of how object and array data type works. Objects are called dictionaries or maps in other programming languages. Just like objects, arrays are frequently used.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// Object literal in JavaScript\\r\\n\\r\\nconst person = {\\r\\n  name: \'Tamal\',\\r\\n  age: 100,\\r\\n  isAwesome: true,\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nperson.name // \\"Tamal\\"\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nArrays are called lists in other languages. You should know the difference between primitive data types and reference data types such as objects and arrays and how to manipulate them.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// Arrays\\r\\n\\r\\nconst fruits = [\'apple\', \'banana\', \'mango\']\\r\\n\\r\\nfruits[0] // \\"apple\\"\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Composing basic programs\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter learning the programming syntax you should also know how to make basic programs. Programming is building stuff and you should be confident in constructing them. After taking a programming course you should practice on your own to make a few practice projects. Being able to build things is very important because, in Node JS, we have to build out a large complex application. A large complex application is nothing more than a combination of a lot of small programs put together so don\u2019t underestimate the power of composing.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Fixing bugs, finding a solution online\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen building the backend of a Node application, you will often run into problems. You should have an open mind to find these bugs and look for solutions online. Often times the issue can be solved with a quick Google search and finding a working piece of code in Stack Overflow. It\u2019s completely okay to do this and professional software developers always Google and search for existing solutions and snippets of code. You should build the quality of not getting frustrated and always finding the solution to your coding problems.\\r\\n\\r\\n## JavaScript specific concepts that are heavily used in Node JS\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point, you should be able to decide if you need to take a JavaScript course before taking on Node or not. If you do decide to take a JS course, I want you to double down on these particular skills because these are frequently used in Node JS. It\u2019s possible to learn each of these individual things while you are learning Node JS. For that case, I would suggest you get a rough idea by reading the list below and work accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Callbacks\\r\\n\\r\\nJavaScript is a functional programming language and the way the runtime works, it has the feature to have callbacks. In JS, you can supply another function as a function parameter. A callback is a function that will run at a certain point. You will often encounter functions that include another function that includes another function. If you want to work with Node JS and JavaScript in particular, you will be encountering a lot of callbacks.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// JavaScript can take a function as a parameter\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction doSomething(a, b, callback) {\\r\\n  let result = callback(a, b)\\r\\n  return result\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\ndoSomething(2, 2, sumOfTwoNumbers)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Promises\\r\\n\\r\\nPromises are the modern version of callbacks and they do the same thing that callbacks do but their syntax is very easy to understand. Similar to callbacks, you can have one function do something and it will have another method attached to it when the first function completes the task. Under the hood, promises are doing the exact thing that callbacks do. In Node JS, you will encounter some modules that have callbacks and others have the new promises. As a Node developer, you should have a good grasp of both to make your life easier.\\r\\n\\r\\n### let and const\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are keywords for declaring variables in JavaScript. Apart from the var keyword, let and const lets you declare variables at the block scope. const is used to create constants, a value that stays the same. let is used to create variables that can be changed. You will find lots of tutorials and courses that make use of const & let and explains to you what to use where. As long as you know what they do, you will be fine in building your server.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nlet city = \'London\'\\r\\ncity = \'Berlin\'\\r\\n\\r\\nconst country = \'France\'\\r\\ncountry = \'Greece\' // Error, Can\'t do that\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### JavaScript object literals\\r\\n\\r\\nObjects are heavily used in Node JS application development. You should know the syntax and the shortcuts for working with them. In Node, objects are used for setting configurations for various NPM modules. Objects are also used for making data for your application. You should learn the modern ES6 syntax for object destructuring and prop name shortcuts.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// Object literal in JavaScript\\r\\n\\r\\nconst person = {\\r\\n  name: \'Tamal\',\\r\\n  age: 100,\\r\\n  isAwesome: true,\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nperson.name // \\"Tamal\\"\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Anonymous functions and arrow functions (lambda)\\r\\n\\r\\nSince JavaScript allows functions to be passed into various functions, you will often find anonymous functions used throughout the development. These are unnamed functions that you can use as an expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother popular anonymous function format is the arrow function or lambda functions.\\r\\n\\r\\nArrow functions are similar to the ones found in Java and in C# and they did confuse me a lot when I was just starting out. When working with React JS or Node JS, you will find people often using arrow functions instead of regular functions, so it\u2019s good to have an idea of how it works.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// Anonymous function\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction(a, b) {\\r\\nreturn a + b;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// shorthand for anonymous fn\\r\\n\\r\\n(a, b) => {\\r\\nreturn a + b;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// shorthand lambda\\r\\n(name) => name;\\r\\n\\r\\n// Used inside another function\\r\\nfruits.map((item) => item);\\r\\n\\r\\n// .map() is a built in array method\\r\\n// which takes a function as a parameter\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Functional programming\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will come across a lot of functional programming concepts while working with JavaScript and Node JS. If you are unfamiliar with this programming pattern it might seem a little odd at first. In functional programming, functions are treated as if they are regular data types. You can supply functions as arguments to other functions as mentioned earlier. You can also return functions as a return type from another function. Finally, one thing that you will see most often is assigning a function to a variable. You will find that often times anonymous or arrow functions are assigned to regular variables instead of declaring them. So be prepared to encounter all these functional tricks when working with Node JS.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Array methods\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the most common array methods are map, filter, reduce, and forEach. These functions allow developers to do quick array manipulations. Most JavaScript developers like to use array methods instead of the plain old for-loop. All of these methods accept a function as a parameter (arrow functions used most often) so be ready to see them in action.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Common JS modules\\r\\n\\r\\nIn modern JavaScript development, the code is split into multiple files and you have to explicitly import and export when you want to use the functionality. In React JS, you have import and export directives, however, as of writing this article, they are not fully supported in recent versions of Node JS yet. Node JS uses common JS modules for import-export. Node uses built-in global methods require for including JS files and module.exports for exporting functionality. These are not that difficult and once you use a few times you will get the hang of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// import export in JavaScript\\r\\n\\r\\nimport React from \'react\'\\r\\n\\r\\nexport default MyComponent\\r\\n\\r\\n// equivalant in NodeJS context\\r\\n\\r\\nconst express = require(\'express\')\\r\\n\\r\\nmodule.exports = router\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Final words\\r\\n\\r\\nNode JS opens the world of possibilities by using a single language JavaScript for both the front end and the back. With a solid foundation in programming concepts and JavaScript, you can be a pro in Node JS in no time. If you already have the foundation covered, I suggest you take on a Node course and learn JavaScript as you go. On the other side, if JS is your first language or you are out of touch for many years, then go and brush up the concepts mentioned in this article. Even if you do go out and spend extra time learning the ropes of JavaScript, the time will be spent well because it\u2019s a great language to keep on your arsenal. That being said, here are some final tips I want to share with you.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Get the programming basics down first, take a course if you have to\\r\\n- Focus on the JavaScript specific concepts to have an easy time with Node\\r\\n- Build something! don\u2019t worry, you will do just fine!\\r\\n  Comment on this post and let me know what you think\\r\\n\\r\\n## Comments:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Leo**: I love your article, I already covered the basic js moving unto the intermediate and I study to be a full-stack js developer with react and node as my main target. Thanks again.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Adale**: I\u2019ve been spinning my wheels looking at all these promises and courses online but very few take the time to explain things quickly and simply. I haven\u2019t replied to a blog post in many years. I am so appreciative of what you do here. This site is a real resource.

You will be safe using a version that is higher than the version used by the instructor.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that you know which version to pick when working with Node JS, let me tell you a bit more about the Node version lifecycle.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What is Node LTS?\\r\\n\\r\\nLTS stands for Long Term Support and the recommended version for most users. Nodejs org makes new versions frequently with new features, bug fixes, and performance optimizations. As a general rule, we can safely assume that the latest version is always the best version to use. A major node version increments the first number like this: 6.x.x, 7.x.x, 8.x.x, 9.x.x, where the leftmost number is the most significant one and the rest of the numbers are minor changes to the software like 14.15.0.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Major versions are current for 6 months\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will notice that in the Node download page you will find two versions, one marked as LTS and the other marked as Current. Instinctively you would want to download and start using the current version of the software. However, this version is not intended for you (the general user) but for the library authors.\\r\\n\\r\\nNode JS has many uses. Nowadays Node is not only used by the backend developer but it\u2019s also hugely used by the frontend tool developers. Various tools that make it easy to compile code such as Webpack, Gulp, Browserify, and others heavily rely on Node JS. Frontend frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, Svelte are also dependent on Nodejs. Testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, and Enzyme also make use of the latest features of Node and NPM.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a new major release of Node, it will allow these library owners 6 month time to download and make their tools compatible with new features and updates.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo in a nutshell, the current odd number Node JS versions such as 13.x.x, 15.x.x, 17.x.x and so on are targeted to the maintainers of various tools.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 6 months, the odd numbered versions become unsupported, so there is no point in using these versions for development.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Node LTS versions are good for 30 months (2+ years)\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first 6 months have passed and library vendors have enough time to test and implement new features into their tools, the even number versions (12.x.x, 14.x.x, and 16.x.x) will enter the LTS or Long Term Support phase. By the time you get access to an LTS version, you can rest assured that all of your favorite NPM tools are tested and supported by this version of Node.\\r\\n\\r\\n![node version timeline](./images/timeline.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis LTS version will be further supported by the Open JS foundation for the next 30 months (2 and a half years). So if you are building a production application, you will get support for it for the next two years and more. The LTS version guarantees that the software will be maintained and critical bugs will be fixed during this period of time. The Node JS website states that \u201cProduction applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases\u201d (Node JS org, 2020).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis all means that if today you start learning with Node JS 16, you are good to deploy a production app with this version till March 2024.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip\\r\\nIf today you start learning with Node JS 16, you are good to deploy a production app with this version till March 2024\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## What goes into major Node releases?\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Node versions are all about speed, stability, feature updates and bug fixes. With each new version, Node JS is getting faster and better as the technology improves. For example, Node version 10 is 2x faster than Node version 6 (Nodejs blog, 2018), so it\u2019s a good enough reason to always use the latest version. Since Node is built on other technologies, such as the V8 engine and the ECMA script, it has to stay current with new features and improvements.\\r\\n\\r\\n### V8 Engine\\r\\n\\r\\nV8 is Google Chrome\u2019s JavaScript engine and the engine that was used to run code in the Node JS runtime. With new updates of the V8 engine, it is important to bring the same level of code execution to Node JS. For this reason, the people at Node will implement new versions of V8 into the Node JS runtime.\\r\\n\\r\\n### New JavaScript features\\r\\n\\r\\nAs new JavaScript features come up every year, it is important to stay up to date with the current language features and implement them into the Node runtime. As you may know, you can\u2019t use all the latest JS features in Node JS. With each new update to Node, it brings more and more new JavaScript features to the runtime environment.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Key changes in major Node versions\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s clear that you should use the latest and greatest LTS version of the Node JS runtime, however, you will often come across old Node versions in apps or used in old tutorials. For that, it\u2019s good to have an idea of some of the key aspects of major Node versions.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Node 6 implemented ES6\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the most important update for a JavaScript developer is to be able to use the modern ES6 version. Node 6 implemented the new ECMA Script 6 which is a significant improvement in JavaScript.\\r\\n\\r\\nES6 introduced keywords like let and const, arrow functions, destructuring, template literals and many more. In today\u2019s web development, it sucks not to be able to code in ES6. So if you come across a Node tutorial, make sure it\u2019s using version 6 and up.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/1.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, 99% of the modern JavaScript features are now supported with Node version 6 and up (Node.green, 2020).\\r\\n\\r\\n### Node 8 implemented Async Await\\r\\n\\r\\nAsync Await was implemented in Node 8 (Cyren, 2017). Async and Await are special keywords you can use in functions to make them wait for promises. It\u2019s a simpler way to use the promises in your JS code.\\r\\n\\r\\nNode 10 added promisified fs module\\r\\nfs is a built-in module in Node for reading and writing to the file system. In the past, we had to use callbacks for working with the file system module but in Node 10, we get the option of promisified fs (Node blog, 2018).\\r\\n\\r\\n### Node 12 implemented ES6 modules\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you worked with both React and Node, you will notice that in Node, you use the require method to include a module, while in React you use import to do the same. This is because Node JS is still behind when it comes to implementing the latest and greatest JavaScript features. Node 12 introduced experimental use of import and export modules (Node blog, 2019) and I am sure by the time you use Node 14 and up, it will be able to use it with no issues.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Can I install multiple Node versions on my computer?\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, **you can use the NVM Node Version Manager app to install and use multiple versions of the Node JS runtime environment**. NVM lets you easily switch between Node versions on the fly in your local development machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was using the latest node version on my local computer then sometimes ago I was needed to use the old Node 8 version to run a particular project. I looked around and found NVM for windows.\\r\\n\\r\\n## How to install NVM for Windows computers\\r\\n\\r\\nGo here to [find the latest NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases) releases. This is a separate project that lets Windows users use Node version manager.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of writing this article, this is the latest version (the version you see may be different) but you will see a similar page:\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nClick on the **nvm-setup.zip** and download the zip file. Unzip the folder and install the program.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that, go to your terminal (I use the built-in terminal in VS code)\\r\\n\\r\\nType in `nvm -v` to verify that NVM has been installed on your computer.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nType in `nvm list` to list all the node versions you have installed on your computer.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/4.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point, it may show only one version of Node you have installed on your computer.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo install a different version of Node JS, you can type in `nvm install <version_number>` like: `nvm install 12.16.1`\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/5.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/6.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can check out this page to see all the previous Node JS versions.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/7.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you have installed a new version using NVM, once again list them by typing `nvm list`.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/8.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you can select a particular Node version by typing: `nvm use <version>` like I did `nvm use 8.9.4`\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/9.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow type in `node -v` to verify that you are indeed using a different Node JS version:\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/10.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also see that you are using a different NPM version that comes with that particular node installation:\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/11.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you can use a specific version that is required in your project.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid you know about NVM? Tweet this to your followers and let them know,\\r\\n\\r\\n## Final Words\\r\\n\\r\\nNode JS has two different audiences, the regular developers (us) and the open-source contributors (library authors). And for this reason, Node offers two different versions on their download page. For most cases, it\u2019s safe to just go with the latest LTS version of the Node and if you are following a tutorial, just ask your instructor which version you should be using. Now that it\u2019s the end of this article, here are a few things I want you to do:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Download the latest 16.x.x LTS version of Node\\r\\n- Start building something\\r\\n\\r\\n## References\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

Just like you, I always wondered why most people use Express JS and is there another way to build a server without it?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy Express JS is used in Node JS? **Express JS is a minimal framework for building web applications in Node JS. It makes the process of creating a server simple with built-in methods that\u2019s why Express JS is widely used and is the de facto framework for Node.**\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nExpress JS is one framework that rules Node JS development. Express is also a central component for the MEAN stack development (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node).\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Express, it was hard and cumbersome to build out a web server with Node but now you can install Express and run a server within a few lines of codes.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What does Express JS do in Node JS development?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe know that we can use Node JS to build a backend server. Node provides an http module that you can use to check for routes, parse the payloads and supply content. But as you start building multiple routes, this becomes repetitive and a complicated process. Express JS simplifies the process by providing effective route creation and support for middlewares. It gives you all the tools you will need for route creation, parse payloads, create HTML view pages, work with middleware functions and connect to databases.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo in a nutshell, Express JS is used to build out web applications with Node JS. Why it\u2019s used and instead of other frameworks? Because this is the one framework that 93% of the JavaScript developers like to use (State of JavaScript, 2019).\\r\\n\\r\\n## What are middlewares in Express JS?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Express framework works by making use of middlewares. Every route you create with Express JS will have the option to supply a middleware. Middleware is like a simple function that can do a certain task. Let\u2019s say I create a middleware called validateEmail to check if the given email is a valid email address or not. I can pass this middleware into the route and when it reaches that part, it will run the function for validating email addresses. With middle-wares, you can make modular code that you can reuse all over your application that makes it easy for development.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Can I build a web server with plain Node JS without a framework?\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, you can build a web server using only the built-in Node modules without using any frameworks. In fact, people used to build servers using the built-in http and https modules before Express came along. After learning how to build a full-stack web application with Node, I got interested to learn how I can build a server with vanilla Node. The process is a bit complicated and I soon realized how easy Express makes to build a server. If you are interested to learn how to build a server with the built-in modules, you can check out this course from Pirple.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Does Express JS come built-in with Node JS?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Express JS is a hugely popular framework for Node, it does not comes built-in with Node JS. To use this framework you will have to install express via NPM in your node project.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why JavaScript developers love Express JS?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs mentioned previously that over 93% of the JavaScript developers are satisfied using the Express framework and would love to keep using it. Other than developer satisfaction, there are some other concrete reasons for using this framework. One big reason for using Express is that the framework is minimal and unopinionated. By this, it means, that with Express you can structure the app any way you want. Let me share what I mean by this.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Express JS is minimal and unopinionated\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the official Express JS homepage, it\u2019s a \u201cFast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js\u201d (ExpressJS, 2020). Express uses less overhead in the core framework so that makes it minimal and a good choice for building out large web applications. You don\u2019t want to have a framework that fills your codebase with lots of bloatware that you are never gonna use. With minimal code, the framework will not slow down your entire application.\\r\\n\\r\\nExpress JS is fast because of minimal footprint, but it also helps you build a server quickly. With a few lines of code, you can create a simple web server. With some more lines, you can create routes. When I went to create a server using the core Node modules, I realized how long and how many lines of code and logic it takes just to serve a \u201cHello World\u201d page. This made me realize how quick and easy it is to build a server with a simple Express JS module.\\r\\n\\r\\nExpress is unopinionated and does not dictate you on how to structure your web applications. With Express you can structure your app any way you want; connect to any type of databases like MySQL, MongoDB or PostgreSQL; pick and use the view engine that you like the most such as pug, ejs, handlebars, mustache and many more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you have a specific need to fulfill you can pick another framework that best suits your needs. But did you know that other popular frameworks are actually built with Express?\\r\\n\\r\\n### Other frameworks are built on Express JS\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are dozens of frameworks out there in the JavaScript ecosystem (Node.js Frameworks, 2020) and you know what, almost all of them are built on top of the core Express JS framework. Popular frameworks such as NestJS, Sails, Feathers JS, Loopback, and Graphql-yoga are among the few that are built using Express (ExpressJS, 2020). Another alternative framework to Node is Koa JS that is created by the same people who created Express JS. This shows the dominance of one single framework in the Node ecosystem.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are just getting started with Node and you don\u2019t know where to start, you can safely pick Express JS. Then when you are leveling up and know what exactly you need, you can pick up other frameworks.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Companies using Express JS\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the top 10,000 websites on the internet, about 942 (9.42%) of the websites use Express JS (BuiltWith, 2020). This includes sites and services like PayPal, Glassdoor, Windows, Accenture, IBM, FOX Sports, Myntra, Uber, Yandex and many more (ExpressJS, 2020). Large companies using Express in their production application is a good enough reason to choose the Express framework and one of the dominating factors why people use it.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nExpress JS makes it super simple to build routes, connect to the database, work with middlewares and serve dynamic HTML pages to build out web servers. It\u2019s a fantastic tool that can speed up your Node development when you are just starting out. So I suggest you go ahead and give Express a try. Here are some steps to help you along the way,\\r\\n\\r\\nTake a look at the Express JS documentation\\r\\nBuild a Node server using Express JS\\r\\nLeave a comment on this post and let me know what you are going to build\\r\\n\\r\\n## References\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

Well, my friend, you are in luck because today I am going to tell you exactly how long it takes to become a full-stack developer using Node JS sharing my own learning experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much time does it take to learn Node JS? **It takes around 3 months to fully learn Node JS and be able to build a functional full-stack application. If you already know some other programming, you can get the basics down within a few week\u2019s time.**\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is because there are so many moving parts that go into building a working app such as a social network. It took me a similar amount of time by following a video course that took me from a beginner to a pro in deploying web applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, the actual time to learn anything solely depends on your personality, how much time you have available to commit to learning, and what kind of skills you already have that you can take advantage of.\\r\\n\\r\\n## My skill level when I started learning Node JS\\r\\n\\r\\nI started learning Node JS while having good web development skills in HTML and CSS. I didn\u2019t have any prior JavaScript skills, other than taking a programming fundamental course many years ago. When I was taking the Node course, **I had no experience working with JavaScript and how backend development works**. So when I was learning Node, I was also learning backend development and JavaScript at the same time. It\u2019s completely fine to learn JavaScript while you are learning Node JS.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am going to assume you have a similar skill level that I had when I started learning Node and will write the rest of this article according to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n## This much time I spent everyday learning Node\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was learning Node JS backend development, I dropped everything that I was doing previously. As a freelancer, I didn\u2019t have any job or study during that time so I put all my focus and effort into learning this new skill. I was watching videos and writing code all the time during the day. I recall that **I was spending roughly 4 focus hours in front of my computer every day for my Node learning**. This time includes watching the video lessons, taking notes and then redoing what my instructor was doing.\\r\\n\\r\\n**To be honest, it was frustrating at times and I don\u2019t recommend anyone to rigorously learn something like the way I did**. I wanted to learn Node JS as fast as I can so I took this painful route. As it turns out, it still took me 3 months to complete the entire paid course from Wes Bos.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire Node course that I took was only 10 hours in length, but it takes way more than that to fully understand and then implement each of the concepts.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning A word on courses\\r\\nPreviously I adviced people to finish the entire course that you are taking no mater how long it takes, but it\'s only going to make you miserable, just like it made me. Instead pick out the parts of the course you are interested in and mix and match your learning.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to learning Node JS, I was a serial quitter. I took so many programming courses and failed to complete them so many times. So this time I was determined to finish what I started. But after I went through the pain, I had great results to show to the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What I was able to build after learning Node JS\\r\\n\\r\\nThe course that I took taught me how to build a product listing site. This included user registration, logging in, posting user-generated content, and build REST API for favorites. I would make a new project from scratch the build out every feature I learned so far.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is my node practice folder. Almost half of the projects I built during my initial three-month learning period.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nI made practice projects that look like these:\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/2.jpg)\\r\\n![](./images/3.jpg)\\r\\n![](./images/4.jpg)\\r\\n![](./images/5.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you can see, most of these practice projects were more geared towards social media sites, because that\u2019s what I wanted to build. My first real project was building a Twitter clone out of my existing Node skills.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/6.jpg)\\r\\n![](./images/7.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nTwitter Clone\\r\\nThis was a fun project to do since I also learned how to deploy the project on the internet, and I quickly deployed it onto a free Heroku service to show it to the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that, I kept on building other projects like the Reddit clone, APIs, and many client projects. It was great to see my hard work finally paid off and bringing fruits of my labor. I also started getting many job inquiries from many different companies for interviews (because I was sharing my work on the internet). I even got a job offer later that year (which I declined.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of all, I was happy that this time I did not quit and now I have a valuable skill that allows me to build full-stack applications. If you are pumped up reading my Node journey, now let me give you some tips on how to learn Node JS efficiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n## An efficient strategy for quickly learning Node JS\\r\\n\\r\\nNode is a huge topic and there is a lot to cover. You can spend years and years learning about it and will still feel you haven\u2019t learned it enough. This is why you have to be smart with your learning goals. Instead of learning everything, there is about Node JS, take a small portion, and be the best at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had the goal to learn how to build a full-stack application with Node so that I can make social networks. I think you should also follow this path and learn how to quickly build a similar project. The fastest way to build a Node server is by using a framework called Express JS.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Use Express JS to build your Node server\\r\\n\\r\\nExpress JS is the simplest and the most popular framework for building a server application with Node JS. With this framework, you can get a server up and running within a few lines of code. Basically express is a yet another custom module you will install in your application and use all the methods provided by it. When working with Node JS, you will find that you are installing custom NPM modules for doing almost everything. It is common in the JavaScript ecosystem to use other people\u2019s code. In this case, these codes are bundled in NPM modules.\\r\\n\\r\\nExpress has many methods that allow you to create routes, controllers, set the view engines, connect to the database and many more built-in configuration that makes it easier for you to set up a server. You can even use an express-generator to start a project with boilerplate code. Building a server is simply creating routes that can handle various HTTP methods.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Master the basic HTTP methods\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you are building a server, all you have to do is to create a few routes to handle some HTTP methods. The frontend of your application will talk to your server using these routes and the methods. Let\u2019s say you have a home page that will list all the tweets posted by all the users. The frontend will request to GET all the tweets to the /all route in the server. The server will then load up all the tweets at that handler and send it to the frontend for displaying.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly, you may have a textbox on your frontend that will send a POST request whenever someone posts a new tweet. The frontend will send that POST request to the /post handler in the server, that the server will respond to accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith backend building you are going to make routes that handle GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and other HTTP requests for making basic CRUD operations(Create, Read, Update, and Delete). If you can learn the gist of how these methods work, you will be set for 80% of the work required in Node. In fact, these are common among every other backend server programming.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\u2019s a tip: You can build the entirety of your server by using just the GET and POST methods.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut above all, you should not worry about memorizing all the little things.\\r\\n\\r\\n### You don\u2019t have to memorize everything\\r\\n\\r\\nNode JS backend development is all about setting up different configuration files. It took me a long time to realize that there is no point in trying to memorize different configuration options. You see with Node and Express development, you are going to use a dozen third party NPM modules. All of these modules are created differently and have different configuration options. I tried to memorize and test myself time after time only to get frustrated. The truth is, you will still do well if you just look up the documentation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\u2019s how I want you to approach this:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Decide what functionality you want to achieve\\r\\n2. Search Google and find the best module for the job\\r\\n3. Check their documentation or watch a video to configure it\\r\\n4. Test that it\u2019s working as you wanted to\\r\\n5. Repeat the process\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early days, feel free to rely on all the modules out there. Once you get to an advanced level and know how to work with the built-in modules, maybe you will write your own custom functionality. But most importantly, practice and build a lot of stuff.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Practice and build a lot of projects\\r\\n\\r\\nI practiced a lot when taking the node course. This is the key to learning and leveling up quickly. Don\u2019t just sit there with your course project, build new things with what you already know. I built new projects from scratch every day that helped me practice my skills and build out a small portfolio.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, don\u2019t be afraid of putting out your work to the world. Learn how to deploy your project to the internet and show it to everyone. Sharing my work helped me learn more and get new opportunities. After finishing the Node course in 3 months, it was time for me to spend time building new projects. While building new projects, I got to learn even more stuff about Node JS.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that you have the tips to learn Node in record time, let me share some next steps for you to get started immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Next Steps\\r\\n\\r\\n- Decide what you want to build with Node JS\\r\\n- Find a course that shows you how to do it and finish the entire course\\r\\n- Build lots of practice projects and learn from doing\\r\\n\\r\\n## Comments:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Chuks**: Hello, Tamal. Thanks a lot for your very revealing article. I stumbled upon it on Quora after going through lots and lots of articles on JavaScript/Node.js. I have to say that you sort of described my current predicament.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, I am actually new to programming. I started with Python last year (my first programming language), but then I got frustrated midway when I couldn\u2019t build anything with it, and so I left it. I took up JavaScript this year, and because I wanted to do backend, I also started learning node. I bought two courses on Udemy, one on JavaScript, and the other on Node.js (by Andrew Mead).\\r\\n\\r\\nJust like you mentioned, I am learning them side by side. I know just the basics of JavaScript, but I do not want to waste any time so I began on node immediately. I\u2019m only just about 23 videos into the course (The course has almost 350 videos). I can\u2019t wait to actually build something just so I can see the fruits of my labor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would love to be in correspondence with you and also follow you on social media, just to get some tips and advice as I embark on this journey. Once again thanks for this article, and I have to say that it has motivated me. I hope I would be able to complete this course because I am now fed up of leaving things halfway.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Tamal: Hello Chuks, thank you for your insightful comment and I am so glad that my journey motivated you to stick with it. JS is good because you can quickly build stuff that you can show to other people. This is an awesome way to keep you motivated while you are learning.\\r\\n>\\r\\n> Stick to your current Udemy course and try to complete most of it (if not 100%). For a large course that has 350 videos, you can take this shortcut: Instead of making it a task to view all the videos, you can review the section and learn the gist of the section. For example, if you have a section called REST API with 20 videos, you may learn the topic by viewing only 3-4 important videos from that and make it complete. You can always get back to other videos when you have finished a few practice projects.\\r\\n>\\r\\n> Thank you for wanting to stay in touch with me. Unfortunately, last year I deleted all my social media accounts and stopped broadcasting what I am working on. You can bookmark this site for new articles and also send me an email to stay in touch privately.\\r\\n>\\r\\n> See you on the comments!\\r\\n\\r\\n**Mohit Kumar**: Hey, thanks for the tips. Just to give you a little background: I actually am a fresher who has been working in a company that uses dotnet technology. But the problem is that most of the stuff that is being used is older versions of the technologies. For instance, they have still not moved on to dotnet core and are stuck on an older version. Angular 1.7 is still being used which is quite old as compared to the latest version. Getting recruited directly from college, it wasn\u2019t easy for us Freshers as the training the company provided was very bad for people who had no background in these technologies. Now 9 months on, I still feel I have not adjusted entirely. I had wanted to learn some new technology for the past few months now and I have recently developed an interest in learning Node js. So a couple of days ago, I started learning MEAN stack development mainly through YouTube. I am enjoying it at present, everything seems so great in Node. And I seem to be picking up the basics at least quite quickly. The only experience of JavaScript I have is with angular that we use in our current company.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow coming to some of my questions, what do you have to say about working with dotnet technology from a career perspective? And should I learn Node js by myself for a few months and seek a job in MEAN stack technology? How much scope does Node/MEAN stack have from a career perspective and from a versatility perspective in building different types of applications?\\r\\n\\r\\n> Tamal: Hello Mohit, thank you for your comment. I understand your need to work with the latest technologies. You have to find some time out of your job and build a few side projects with the MEAN stack. As for the career perspective, I still don\u2019t have in-depth industry knowledge so I can\u2019t say for sure. But what I have seen so far, technology stacks change all the time.\\r\\n>\\r\\n> Ruby on Rails was all the hype, now it\u2019s Node, then it will become Golang. Just because it\u2019s not the hype, doesn\u2019t mean people don\u2019t use RoR anymore. In this industry, you have to learn a lot of technologies over your lifetime so learn how to build great software and don\u2019t focus so much into specific tech stacks.\\r\\n>\\r\\n> And about dotnet, I don\u2019t want my opinion to change your mind. It\u2019s a good technology and I am looking forward to moving towards .NET sometimes in the future, but for now, I am going to master Node JS and build a few projects until I become fully satisfied. dotnet here is the variable, any technology that solves the business problems is valuable. Learn how to solve business problems with technology and you will have better career opportunities."},{"id":"is-nodejs-programming-language","metadata":{"permalink":"/tamalwebsite/is-nodejs-programming-language","editUrl":"https://github.com/tamalweb/tamalwebsite/tree/master/blog/2020/1-27-is-nodejs-programming-language/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2020/1-27-is-nodejs-programming-language/index.md","title":"Is Node JS a Programming Language?","description":"Node is often compared with other backend languages such as PHP and Python, but is it actually a language?

Today I am going to answer that question once and for all.\\r\\n\\r\\n![featured](./images/featured.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nIs Node JS a programming language? **Node JS is not a programming language, it uses JavaScript language as the main programming interface. Node is a desktop application (or runtime environment) that runs JavaScript files. It mainly reads and writes files on a computer/server and does networking.**\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nNode runtime can be compared to the JVM Java Virtual Machine or the IDLE Python interpreter. Whenever you want to write a program in a language, you have to install the software on your computer first. Think Node JS as that interpreter but for JavaScript files.\\r\\n\\r\\nI often see people making a comparison of Node with other languages which then leads to silly fights between people that \u201cyou can\u2019t make a comparison because it\u2019s not a language\u201d and all that. But when people do such comparisons, what they really mean is Node as the complete thing, and not just a language or the tool. So let me tell you a bit more about this runtime environment.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What is the Node runtime environment?\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike other languages like Python, Ruby and Go, JavaScript didn\u2019t have any kind of runtime environment. JS was made exclusively for the browser and it could only do certain things within the confinement of a browser like Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. As a result, we don\u2019t have any print command in JavaScript, nor any file read & write option because JS doesn\u2019t have any access to the computer\u2019s file system. JavaScript was limited for doing simple page effects only. That changed when Ryan Dahl created the Node runtime environment (JSConf Europe, 2009).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Node runtime environment is an application created in C++ which allowed the user to manipulate files on the computer. Dahl picked JavaScript as the programming interface for the Node runtime, and thus the name Node.js came (Dahl, 2009).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Node environment was made similar to how the browser environment was made but with more capabilities so that we can make a web server out of it. This made it possible to write the backend of an application in JavaScript.\\r\\n\\r\\nI won\u2019t go in much detail of how exactly the Node runtime works, but I can tell you one thing that JavaScript gave Node a huge advantage when it comes to running a server and reading and writing files. The speed of Node JS made it possible to make efficient web applications and tools.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why JavaScript was picked for the Node runtime?\\r\\n\\r\\nRyan Dahl, the creator of Node, picked JavaScript as the language because it supports all the features he needed and a large number of developers already know how to write it. To build high performant server applications we should use the non-blocking event I/O model; luckily JavaScript is built in such a way that it already supports callbacks and events (Dahl, 2009).\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeYvFl7li9E\\r\\n\\r\\nTo give you a clear example, let\u2019s say I tell Node to write the user information in the database. Node will then send the request to the database. While the data is being written to the database, Node will not wait for it, instead, it will move on to the next task on the list. When the database gets back to Node, it will resume and do the appropriate action. This single attribute makes it possible to make faster and more efficient server applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong other reasons, Dahl also mentioned that he picked JavaScript because it allows callbacks and has the option to supply functions as function parameters. JavaScript is a unique language and compared to other languages such as PHP, Java, and Python, it can do read-write operations much faster using a single thread.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the way, Java and JavaScript are two different languages.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Are Java and JavaScript the same thing?\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are not. Java is an object-oriented general-purpose compiled programming language. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a specific-purpose interpreted scripting language. The confusion happens for having the same name because when Java was popular, JavaScript was created to bring Java developers to the web (Netscape, 1995).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor simplicity, Java is a platform for making desktop, web, and mobile (android) apps, while JavaScript is used for making web applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth languages have similar looking syntax because JavaScript was created based off of Java. The one difference between their syntax is: in Java, you have to define the type of the variable, while in JavaScript you don\u2019t have to set the type of a variable. This is why JavaScript is called a weakly typed language and Java being the strongly typed lang.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the difference between browser JS and Node JS?\\r\\nThe creator of Node JS took the original JavaScript language and made a custom implementation to it. To start off, in the browser, the global object is called window, but in Node, the global object is called global. This is because there is no browser window in a Node environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Node is capable of reading and writing files, there is a global method require which can read and include files from the directory. There is another module called fs (file system) for doing all the input and output operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the browser-related APIs like the fetch, localStorage, Notification is not available in Node because it\u2019s not a browser.\\r\\n\\r\\nNode made few custom methods but kept the same name as the browser for consistency; like the console.log, setInterval, and setTimeout could be named anything but wasn\u2019t.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn top of that, Node has a list of built-in modules that can help the user build a server and do all the CPU and server related tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What Node JS is used for?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you already know, Node is used for building server-side applications and this was the original plan. However, as time went on, developers found many new ways to use Node. Here are some of the prominent use cases:\\r\\n\\r\\n### Node as a Full Stack Application\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best use of Node JS and the reason why I got into this was to be able to build full-stack web applications. Node is good for building all types of web applications. I made social networks with it such as the Twitter and Reddit clone. Other people have made SaaS applications, chat applications, and many different sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Node, you can create the backend using a framework such as Express JS and build out the frontend with a view engine such as pug. Node renders HTML pages by dynamically generating them from the backend. It\u2019s not just only limited to creating web applications, but you can also create just the backend of a server for any type of application.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Node as the backend API\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother popular use of Node JS is making the backend of any other type of application. You can make an android or iOS app to have it as the frontend and then make the API server using Node.js. Node is good for making REST APIs that can be used on any type of front end. You can even make a desktop application with Java or C++ and have Node to handle the server endpoints.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, I like to make the backend with Node and use React.js as my frontend client application. With that being said, did you know that the biggest use of Node JS is currently in the frontend?\\r\\n\\r\\n### Node JS in the frontend\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a server-side platform, ironically Node JS is now hugely used on the frontend.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it\u2019s not the way you are thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing Node in the frontend does not really mean you are running Node.js in the browser. You see Node is very good when it comes to reading and writing lots of files in a short amount of time. Developers have used this feature to build lots of frontend tools. Nowadays, most of the popular tools in frontend development are built and run by Node JS.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, webpack is a popular tool for minimizing JS and CSS files. Webpack does this on the fly using Node. The same goes for other tools like babel, gulp, browserify and many more.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this is the sole reason why you have to download and install Node even when you are working in the frontend using React or Angular. Node JS is everywhere when it comes to building web applications. Even if you are not building a web application, you may still encounter tools that are built using Node.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Advantage of learning Node\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are ever going to build a web application, you will need to learn Node JS. The one big advantage of learning Node is that you will be able to port your skills from frontend to backend and vice versa. If you know how to use JavaScript to build server-side applications, you will find it easier to transition your way into the frontend. If you know how to work with frontend frameworks like React and Vue, you will find it easier to build backend APIs because it\u2019s the same language. You can also reuse your existing code because both ends use JavaScript.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Node is the only tool out there for building the tooling and the backend services, you can make a good career being an expert in it. I am sure, over time there will be more and more uses of Node which you can benefit from.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Final Thoughts\\r\\n\\r\\nNode JS is not a language, it\u2019s a runtime environment, but these days when someone compares Node with another programming language, they mean the entire Node JavaScript ecosystem. The Node ecosystem is huge and so much is happening around it so I suggest you pick one aspect of it, such as building full-stack applications and practice building lots of applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are interested to get started with Node, here are some tips for you:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Learn JavaScript because Node IS JavaScript\\r\\n- Pick one area and be awesome with it, build something\\r\\n- Comment on this post and let me know what do you think of Node\\r\\n\\r\\n## References:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

Out of all the languages and tools, JavaScript helped me quickly build a social networking site using Node JS. As a beginner I found Node JS to have the shortest learning curve when it comes to building a full-stack application such as Twitter and Reddit.**\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that you know you can learn JavaScript as your programming language and use Node JS as your tool to build the site, let me give you an overview of what goes into a full-stack application. I will also share with you why did I pick the JavaScript tech stack and not the other options such as PHP or Ruby on Rails. So without further ado, let\u2019s get going.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What goes into building a social networking website?\\r\\n\\r\\nA social networking site is a kind of dynamic web application that was made popular by sites like MySpace and Facebook. It got even more popular with the creation of Twitter and then came mobile-centric social networking sites like Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe implementation may be different for various sites, but at a very basic level, all of these sites have a few things in common. When you go out and build such an application, you are doing the full-stack development. In other words, you are gonna make every aspect of the app.\\r\\n\\r\\nA full-stack application consists of a frontend and a backend. The backend has many parts including the database. To make it easier to explain, I will talk about databases separately and what role they play in a social media site.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Frontend\\r\\n\\r\\nA social networking site has a public-facing user interface which is usually a page for the non-logged in users. On Facebook when you go to www.facebook.com from a different computer (or when you are logged out) you will see a page instructing you to sign up for an account. You can see a similar theme going on Twitter and Instagram where they prompt you to sign up for a new account or download their mobile app.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will notice that on Twitter, you can see all the tweets from an individual user because Twitter\u2019s policy is to make all the tweets public for the entire world, even to the logged out users. Similarly, Reddit allows everyone to read and consume their site without even having to create an account; they can only post content or reply to other people when they create an account. Another aspect of a dynamic website is that it changes based on the user.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you log in to Facebook and visit www.facebook.com on your browser, you will find that the page shows completely different content. This page will now show the home feed of the updates from your friends, the brands and celebrities you follow and the posts from the groups you have joined.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly, on Twitter, the home page is a custom feed of all the tweets from the people you follow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Reddit, the homepage will be a personalized feed containing the subreddit you are following or frequently browse.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot just that, if your friend logs into any of these social networking sites, they will see a completely different feed based on his/her preferences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the true beauty of a dynamic web application.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are more than a billion social media users and for each of them the content they see on the same page changes from person to person.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may wonder, for a billion users there are a billion profile information pages, but does that mean a web developer had to painstakingly have to build a billion profile pages?\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course not.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe frontend web developer has only created one page for the profile page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The frontend is no more than an empty shell waiting to be populated with user data from the database.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Database\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there are a billion users on Facebook, there must be a way to store and manage all that information, the names, the birthdays, the passwords, the list of their friends, the pages they like, you get the idea!\\r\\n\\r\\nOn top of that, it should be easy and quick to fetch the information of a given person in a short amount of time. To solve this a database is used to store all the dynamic information for your social network.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Simple store of data\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I went on to build a social networking app with Node JS, I learned that a database is nothing more than a simple text file. In fact, I can make a database out of a text file if I wanted to.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery time someone creates a new account, I will create a new entry in my text file with the username, password, and other information. When that user tries to log in again, I will just check if the username exists in my text file and if the given password is correct, I will allow the user to log in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem comes when I have to take and manage more data. In my custom social network, I just can\u2019t have a user log in and do nothing. The user may want to post something, like a Tweet or a status update. I will then have to store status messages on my text file.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe having two different text files for user data is a good idea. I will use my first text file to store the user information and the other text file for all the status updates in my network posted by all the users.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut then comes the problem,\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can I know who posted which status update or which update belongs to which user?\\r\\n\\r\\nA nice solution could be giving a unique ID to each of my users and also putting this ID next to the status update so that each of the status updates will link to a user in my user\u2019s text file and vice versa. This type of relationship is very common in relational databases, and it\u2019s in fact how large complex databases work.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I am reading the user file line by line from top to bottom it will take a significant time for a computer to find particular user info. I will also have to worry about generating unique ids for each of the users, the status updates and any other fields. It turns out, other people before me have already gone through these problems and have come up with a very good solution:\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Real databases\\r\\n\\r\\nA database is nothing but a special data structure to efficiently hold and retrieve data.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Facebook was originally created, Mark Zuckerburg used a MySQL database for building the site. Today there are many different databases to choose from like MySQL, MS SQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Oracle DB, DynamoDB and many more. But at the core, all the databases make it efficient to store and retrieve data about your web application.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I built my first social network I used MongoDB with Node JS. Mongo is a popular No SQL database that is similar to the JSON data format (JSON is data representation in JavaScript object notation). MongoDB goes hand in hand with Node JS because the way it organizes data and the commands to store and retrieve data are similar to JavaScript language.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you go on building a social network, you will have to use a database to store all the dynamic content in it. A database is like the heart of a web application and you must pay extra attention to protect it. If you lose it or the data gets corrupted, your entire database will be gone in an instance. So it\u2019s a good idea to pay a premium for a database and keep regular backups in case something goes wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nA database is the content of a social network, but the brain that makes everything come together is the backend of your application.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Backend\\r\\n\\r\\nA simple HTML, CSS website does nothing, because there is no database to store the content and no mechanism in the backend to do the logic. For every social network out there, the real magic happens in the backend of the application.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The frontend will greet the visitor and take an order (request). The user registers for a new account with a name, email, and password.\\r\\n2. The frontend will then send the request to the backend server. In this case, the information submitted by the user on the form.\\r\\n3. The backend code lives somewhere in the server and is always listening for incoming requests.\\r\\n4. The backend will receive a new request for registering a new user with all the information.\\r\\n5. The backend will check and verify the name, email, and password, making sure the email is not already taken.\\r\\n6. If everything is okay, the backend will create a new entry for the user in the database and tell the front end (response) to log this user into the account and display the home feed.\\r\\n7. The frontend will receive the new response to log the user in and display the home feed so it will do it accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is, of course, a simple representation of the request-response cycle. In a nutshell, every time the user clicks on something on the frontend, every time they post a comment or every time they move to a different page, a new request is sent to the backend for processing; the frontend then gets a new response back with some data to display to the user.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all of this happens in less than a second.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to build a social network, you will have to follow a design pattern. The most popular design pattern for building a social network is the MVC design pattern. MVC stands for Model, View, Controller; Twitter and many other social networking apps and even SaaS apps are built using this pattern. Express JS is a Node JS framework that makes it easy to build an application with the MVC design pattern. Let me share the core concepts in detail below,\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Model\\r\\n\\r\\nModel in MVC is the database layer where all the data is stored that will determine the makeup of the data. In Node.js development when you will be using MongoDB to build your database, you will have to provide the data structure within your server files. For a user, the data structure could be the username, first name, last name, email, password, date of birth, etc. A model is responsible for storing and retrieving the data for the entire application.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### View\\r\\n\\r\\nA view in MVC is the user-facing interface that the user can interact with. When I went to build a social network in Node JS, I used pug to build the dynamic HTML templates. A pug file is like a template where I can include custom JavaScript variables which will render real information to the user. Depending on the kind of user, the view layer can show different information based on the logic. Other options to build a view layer in Node JS are ejs, handlebars, and mustache.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Controller\\r\\n\\r\\nA controller in MVC is the main logic or the brain of the application. In Node JS, this is achieved by making lots of functions and handlers for different requests. For each of the different requests, there will be different handlers and different functions.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo illustrate this, when someone posts a status update, the front end will send a POST request to the /post handler with the appropriate content. A controller will have a bunch of different handlers so it will then route this request to the handler which deals with posting new status updates.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\u2019s say the handler is a function in JavaScript called postStatueUpdate. This function will then take the status update and perform other tasks like storing the update to the MongoDB database. When the update is stored, it will send a response to the frontend that it was successful. Now finally the controller will tell the front end to display the new post to the view layer. In a nutshell, the controller is the central nervous system that works constantly with the model and the view layer of the app.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that you have an overview of what goes into a social network, let me tell you why Node JS is a good tool for a beginner to build a full-stack application.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why use Node JS to build a social networking app?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you must be thinking, if I have all the many different options to build my backend server, why would I pick Node.js to build it? The first reason is speed.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Speed\\r\\n\\r\\nNode JS is fast when it comes to reading and writing data to and from the disk. A social networking website is all about user-generated content where users will create posts, comment on them, like, dislike and delete posts. This all means your application will have to do a lot of updates to the database and one thing I learned after building a bunch of applications is, that database updates take a significant amount of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nNode JS is asynchronous and can handle all the requests one after the other without impacting the user interface. In traditional server-side languages, like in PHP, Java, and Python, the server will wait until read/write operation is complete. But in Node JS, it will send the read/write action to the queue and go on working on other requests. When the read/write action is complete, it will respond accordingly. This gives a huge advantage to a social networking site, where lots of requests are happening simultaneously. As a beginner, you would want to pick a tool that is easier to learn fast.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Ease of learning\\r\\n\\r\\nNode JS is JavaScript and if you already know how to build a simple website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the learning curve will cut down in half.\\r\\n\\r\\nNode application structures are built with a straight forward functional approach. When building my Twitter clone application, I used the Express framework which is just a collection of useful methods for making APIs and handlers. The process of making a Node JS application is as simple as making a bunch of functions that call each other at various stages. A typical Node project heavily relies on packages that are functions other people wrote which you can freely use. Node project also has a lot of set configurations that you can just copy-paste from boilerplate code.\\r\\n\\r\\n### One language\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, Node JS lets you use a single language, JavaScript to do both the frontend and the backend of an application. In other technological stacks like in PHP, Python, Ruby, and Java, you will still have to do the frontend logic with JavaScript which means you will have to work with a minimum of two programming languages at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a beginner programmer, I had a hard time working with JavaScript in the front and PHP in the back. I was forgetting one language when I was working with the other. Node JS helped me focus only on JavaScript and I was able to build a full-stack social network with ease.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo if you are a new programmer, and would like to learn a single language to build the entire stack, then pick Node JS. Your JavaScript tech stack will look like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Node JS -The runtime environment for the server\\r\\n- Express JS -Framework to build your application\\r\\n- MongoDB -A powerful database built on JS principles\\r\\n- Pug, ejs, handlebars -for creating the view layer\\r\\n- Frontend frameworks: React, Angular, Vue\\r\\n\\r\\n(You can always learn new backend technologies once you have gained enough confidence with your first few projects.)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Next Steps\\r\\n\\r\\n- Download the latest LTS version of Node JS and install in your computer\\r\\n- Learn how to make a simple web app using the Express JS framework\\r\\n- Make a few learning projects by storing and retrieving from MongoDB database"},{"id":"periodic-table-reactjs","metadata":{"permalink":"/tamalwebsite/periodic-table-reactjs","editUrl":"https://github.com/tamalweb/tamalwebsite/tree/master/blog/2019/12-26-periodic-table-reactjs/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2019/12-26-periodic-table-reactjs/index.md","title":"How I made The Periodic Table with CSS Grid and React","description":"I was looking into the periodic table and trying to memorize all the elements in order.

One afternoon I thought, hey can I make the periodic table with my current CSS skills?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe periodic table is a collection of elements arranged in an oddly structured way. It has already been built in the past, but the question is, can I do it myself without looking?\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Making the Layout\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first task was to arrange all the elements in the peculiar order. The first idea that came into my mind was to make an HTML `<table>`, and put all the items inside the table cells. But tables are old and messy, not to mention, they are very hard to maintain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know CSS grid, so why not use that?\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that point I was a bit skeptical, and thought maybe I will have to use flexbox to achieve the task.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo each of these elements will be a `<div>`, and I will arrange them with CSS.\\r\\n\\r\\nI made the elements like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n![elements](./images/1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nI put 2 classes, the element class to make the box, and element-1 to specifically control the position. I would have 118 elements altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of hand coding all 118 divs for my table, I used the emmet shorthand:\\r\\n\\r\\n![emmet shorthand](./images/2.gif)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table has 18 columns, so I made an 18 column layout with CSS grid.\\r\\n\\r\\n![css grid](./images/3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Tricky Part\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay, so now that I have the container ready, I have to put Hydrogen as the first element and Helium all the way to the right.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did this:\\r\\n\\r\\n![element 2](./images/4.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it worked!\\r\\n\\r\\n![periodic layout](./images/5.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nOne by one, I arranged the elements in this manner. Since I append the exact element\u2019s number as the class for each cell, I can easily control their positions in the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n![arranging the elements](./images/6.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the periodic table, there is a large gap between elements. Let\u2019s take a look \u2014 the original periodic table is very long, about 32 columns:\\r\\n\\r\\n![32 columns](./images/7.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nTo prevent it from being this wide, there are versions of the table which carve out a separate grouping of elements. I had to do the same with my table.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what I did was to separate the Lanthanide and Actinides from the markup and from the CSS.\\r\\n\\r\\n![split](./images/8.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![layout without colors](./images/9.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the layout was ready, it\u2019s now time to add the React.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Filling the Table with Data\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was all fun and games filling out the first few elements. But soon I realized there are 100s of elements that needed to be added. Do I have to type out ever single one? It would suck the fun and life out of me.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo why not do the smart thing and pragmatically fill out the info?\\r\\n\\r\\nI searched the internet and [found one JSON](https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON) which has information about all the 118 items. So I added this data to my application.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the JSON, there is an array of elements. My idea was to reference each element by their order. In an array, the first item starts at 0. That means Hydrogen is at zero, Helium is at 1, Lithium at 2 and so on. To avoid this confusion, I added a placeholder item in the 0th position. So now every element is correctly in the same position as it is in the periodic table.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that I have the data that I need, I can just make one React component to render all the elements and pass in the data as props.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, I thought I need to pass in the name, the number, and the symbol of the element as the props to the React component.\\r\\n\\r\\n![element component](./images/10.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I realized I can just pass in the element\u2019s number, and that would be enough to use the JSON data to extract the entire information about that particular element within the `<Element />` component.\\r\\n\\r\\n![elements](./images/11.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest was all about making the app interactive.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Coloring the Element Groups\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Periodic Table, each of the elements are ordered by their category and they are colored. So instead of coloring each of them I put their categories on the CSS too using the React component.\\r\\n\\r\\n![adding classes](./images/12.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![css styles](./images/13.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis gave the table that cool look.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Making the Table Fit The Screen\\r\\n\\r\\nTo start, I made the table 1000 pixels in wide following the general layout practice. But that made the elements too tiny.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I decided to make it fit the screen and utilized viewport width exclusively. I used vw for the element dimensions, text, and headings throughout the app. This helped to maintain the shape across screen sizes and devices. The table is mainly made for desktop screens, but it still looks okay on tablets too.\\r\\n\\r\\n![responsive design](./images/14.gif)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Final Touches\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table is not complete if it just sits there doing nothing. I added a panel which displays additional information about the element when selected. React was great for this job. So why don\u2019t you see it for yourself in action here?\\r\\n\\r\\n![periodic table version 1](./images/15.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are more things happening in the code, why don\u2019t you dig inside and see it yourself?

However, with the limited scope of the lesson, I couldn\u2019t find a project to build.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\u2019m playing Fruit Ninja these days. After every round, it shows interesting fruit facts. I got an idea to make an API that will display random fruit facts in JSON format. This way I can put my knowledge to use while building something fun.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nI built this simple API which shows interesting fruit facts in JSON format. When you type in `localhost:3000/apple` or any other available fruits, it will spit out this data.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe API is simple yet sophisticated. This is the first time I\u2019m building a URL slug which acts as a variable. It\u2019s the same as `/:fruit` in express.js.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suggest you [open the up the code](https://github.com/tamalweb/fruit-facts/blob/master/index.js) and follow along with this post.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea is to take the full URL `http://localhost:3000/mango` and split it into parts. Then I take the path /mango and strip out any slashes to get a final clean trimmed path mango after which I can match the slug against my route handlers. I learned this way doing it from Pirple\u2019s Node Masterclass course.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nlet parsedUrl = url.parse(req.url, true)\\r\\nlet trimmedPath = parsedUrl.pathname.replace(/^\\\\/|\\\\/+$/g, \'\')\\r\\nif (!trimmedPath) trimmedPath = \'index\'\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nI collected these fruit facts from a wiki page. I will write about how I scrapped those facts with JavaScript in another post.\\r\\n\\r\\nI create an array of available fruits. Many fruits have more than one fact so I created an object of fruits with an array of facts for every fruit:\\r\\n\\r\\n```json\\r\\napple: [\\r\\n    \'The average person eats 65 apples per year\',\\r\\n    \'Apple seeds are mildly poisonous, but not enough to be dangerous to humans\',\\r\\n    \'There are over 10,000 varieties of apples grown around the world\',\\r\\n    \\"25% of an apple\'s volume is air, that\u2019s why they float\\",\\r\\n    \'Over 60 million tons of apples are grown worldwide annually\'\\r\\n  ],\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nOther than the fruit facts, the API also has 3 additional pages \u2014 the homepage, a not found page, and a help page. First I check if the given URL slug is a matching fruit. If it\u2019s a matching fruit, it will serve the fruit handler with the given fruit. If it doesn\u2019t include a matching fruit but matches the other handlers, it will serve them accordingly:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nlet chosenHandler\\r\\n\\r\\nif (fruits.includes(trimmedPath)) {\\r\\n  chosenHandler = handlers.fruit\\r\\n} else {\\r\\n  chosenHandler =\\r\\n    typeof router[trimmedPath] !== \'undefined\'\\r\\n      ? router[trimmedPath]\\r\\n      : handlers.notFound\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThen all is left to do is to call the chosenHandler function and pass in the callback function:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n  chosenHandler(trimmedPath, function(statusCode, payload) {\\r\\n    statusCode = typeof statusCode === \'number\' ? statusCode : 200;\\r\\n    payload = typeof payload === \'object\' ? payload : {};\\r\\n    let payloadString = JSON.stringify(payload);\\r\\n    // Send the response\\r\\n    res.setHeader(\'Content-Type\', \'application/json\');\\r\\n    res.writeHead(statusCode);\\r\\n    res.end(payloadString);\\r\\n  });\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWe use the native http package to create a web server. The server is built using http.createServer. The createServer function takes a callback where we can handle requests and serve fruit facts or other pages from `chosenHandler`. We then listen to port 3000 using server.listen.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nconst server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\\r\\n// Callback to handle requests with chosenHandler\\r\\n}\\r\\nserver.listen(3000, () => { console.log(\'Server started\') })\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can tinker with the code on my Github page. I suggest you install the JSON viewer extension to see the JSON in a nice formatted way."},{"id":"super-productive","metadata":{"permalink":"/tamalwebsite/super-productive","editUrl":"https://github.com/tamalweb/tamalwebsite/tree/master/blog/2019/9-26-super-productive/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2019/9-26-super-productive/index.md","title":"These 7 Tips Will Make You A Super Productive Programmer","description":"These are some of the general programming tips I want to share with you.

Some of these tips might sound trivial but they can sure help you be more productive. Here goes my 7 tips to help you become a super productive programmer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Learn touch typing\\r\\n\\r\\nTouch typing is typing with all of your 10 fingers. Many computer users don\u2019t know how to touch type and they use one or two fingers to type out. Even I was a two-finger typer for a long time. If you learn touch typing, you can type without looking or even in the dark. You will also be able to type at the speed of your thought. Without it, you will constantly have to look for the keys and make mistakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a programmer, your full attention should be on the problem at hand, not where the keys are. You can learn touch typing within a few weeks by using this free service called TypingClub.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Use a linter to auto-format your code\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many code linting plugins out there that can format your code upon save. Don\u2019t waste your time trying to manually add spaces, missing semi-colons or trying to match your desired syntax format. Use a syntax formatting plugin for your code-editor and let that take care of it for you. Set your style once and don\u2019t ever worry about it again. Clean code is not just efficient, it will also make you look professional. I use Prettier for VS Code to lint my code.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Use half the screen for coding\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are using a single monitor just like me, you can save trouble by making the code editor half the size of your screen. This way you can code on one side and use the rest of your screen for other things like reading the documentation or previewing changes, so you won\u2019t have to switch windows all the time and can focus on the problem at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Learn to use version control (Git) and publish to Github\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to become a software engineer, then you will have to learn how to work in a team. A version control system such as git can help you and your teammates work on the same code all at once. Github is a popular online git repository where you can host your code for free. I use git to version control my files and then upload them to Github. This way I get to have a backup of my code and also show off my work. VS Code has git feature built-in which makes it easier for committing and branching code. If you are having trouble with git commands, take a look at this no bullshit guide to git.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Spend some time learning about your system\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to be super productive, you must know 3 things really well:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Your operating system\\r\\n2. Your code editor (like VS code)\\r\\n3. The language you are working on\\r\\n\\r\\nBy learning about them means you should know the keyboard shortcuts, how to find things and how to troubleshoot errors. Having good knowledge won\u2019t actually make a good programmer, but it will sure make you productive. So when the next time you are not doing anything, look into the different menu items, try different keyboard shortcuts or open up the documentation and learn something new about your system.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Play some games/watch a TV show without guilt\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery once in a while you should play your favorite game or watch a TV show. You cannot just code 24/7, you also need to recharge your mind. When you are playing, don\u2019t feel guilty about it. You may be spending the whole day playing a game, but that\u2019s okay, you need it. When you are playing a game, you can think about the character or the environment, how did the developer program it? What was the variable or conditions that trigger this event? TV shows and movies are stories of people dealing with problems. You can watch a story and get some inspiration to solve your programming problems or build something new. You never know what you can get out of it to use it on your programs, so take some break!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Go away from your computer every once in a while\\r\\n\\r\\nGo out and meet some people, spend some time with your friends and family. Sometimes you want to go out and have some alone time. Treat yourself with a nice dinner or a movie, all by yourself. Going out of the digital world can help you recharge your mind and re-focus on things. You will get back to your work with a fresh mindset.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nDid you find any new tips that can help you be more productive? What is one thing you do to help you get better at code? Feel free to let me know in the comments. While you are reading and sharing this article, I feel I need to get out and apply the last tip.

Sharing passwords with a technical person is a common practice when it comes to outsourcing. But if done incorrectly, your passwords can be exposed to a third party or a hacker.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo prevent this, I am going to outline some of the best practices when it comes to sharing passwords with your designer/developer. Especially when you are hiring them on a marketplace such as Fiverr or Upwork.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Give your developer access to your site without sharing the password\\r\\n\\r\\nMany modern website builders such as Shopify, Wix builder, GoDaddy builder lets you give access to your site to a developer. Shopify even lets the developer build the shop in their own account and then transfer it to yours when the task is complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou just have to enter their username or email in your control panel and they are given developer access to your properties. This eliminates the need to give out your password.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen working with a self hosted WordPress.org website, you can simply create a new user account. Create the new account with admin privileges, and send that user credentials instead of your main one. Once they are done and handed you over the project, you can just simply delete their user account. This is a very convenient and safer option compared to sharing your password.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Use a password manager to share your passwords\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you can\u2019t give access without giving them the password, you can use a password manager to do this for you. You can share it using LastPass. The developer will get an email message asking them to accept the share. They must already have a free LastPass account to use it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they accept your password sharing request, they can log in to that appropriate account without having to look at the actual password. This gives you extra security and will bring peace of mind. In fact, one of my client shared their password with me via Lastpass.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Don\u2019t use the same password for all of your sites\\r\\n\\r\\nMany internet users use the same password for all their internet accounts. If you expose one of them to a hacker, they will be able to get into all of your internet accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this reason you should use different passwords to use on different sites. A password manager such as LastPass can remember these passwords for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI use LastPass as my password manager tool. It has a chrome extension and it auto fills my passwords for various sites. You can generate secure passwords with it. You can also have it memorize all of your passwords.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Some extra caution\\r\\n\\r\\nOften times passwords are shared via instant messages, emails or via text files.

Do you store it into the database?\\r\\n\\r\\nYou don\u2019t!\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should never store the raw password into your application.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome badly coded websites store the raw password into their database.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey store the actual password and even send you via email:\\r\\n\\r\\n![plain text password](./images/1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis means your password is at risk.\\r\\n\\r\\n(by the way, I didn\u2019t code that website, I used a plugin called DAP in WordPress)\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an app developer, you should not store the actual password into your database.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, as a user you should stay away from such sites and inform the webmaster.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Hash the password and store it into your database\\r\\n\\r\\nSo instead of storing the actual password, you cryptographically hash the password and then store the hash instead of the password.\\r\\n\\r\\n![hash saved in database](./images/2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I don\u2019t store the password, then how people are supposed to log back in?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen someone tries to log in, they will enter their password. You will have to run the hashing function again with that given password. Then you match this new hash with the stored hash.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you hash the same password with the same secret key, you will get the same hash string.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it will be a match and you know the password was correct and you go ahead and login the user.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is why when you forget the password, you don\u2019t get to see the password, instead they send you a link to reset the password. Behind the scenes you are just creating a new hash in the system.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Hash the password with a salt\\r\\n\\r\\nNow normally I would hash the password with a secret key. The problem is, two users may have the same password. Let\u2019s say two users have used 1234 as their password. When your system hashes the password, both user will have the same hash. If your database gets stolen and the hacker sees, those 2 users have the same hash, that means their passwords are the same. This makes things easier for the hacker.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo fix this, you have to generate a new string which will act as a salt. This salt will also be saved into the database for each user. Each of these salts will be unique per user.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo next, instead of hashing the password with a secret key, you use the salt to hash the password. That way now you will get a unique hash per user.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Code examples:\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\u2019s how I created a salt using the crypto module in Node.js:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nvar crypto = require(\'crypto\')\\r\\nvar createTheSalt = function () {\\r\\n  return crypto.randomBytes(20).toString(\'hex\')\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here I\u2019m using the salt and the given password to hash the password:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nvar crypto = require(\'crypto\');\\r\\nvar hashThePassword = function(password, salt) {\\r\\n  password =\\r\\n    password.length && typeof password === \'string\' ? password : undefined;\\r\\n  if (password && salt) {\\r\\n    // Create the salt\\r\\n    let hash = crypto\\r\\n      .createHmac(\'sha512\', salt)\\r\\n      .update(password)\\r\\n      .digest(\'hex\');\\r\\n    // Return a salt and hash object\\r\\n    return { salt, hash };\\r\\n  } else {\\r\\n    return null;\\r\\n  }\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the next time you come across a website which sends your actual password when you forgot the password, know that your data is in wrong hands."},{"id":"specializing-in-javascript","metadata":{"permalink":"/tamalwebsite/specializing-in-javascript","editUrl":"https://github.com/tamalweb/tamalwebsite/tree/master/blog/2018/11-5-specializing-in-javascript/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2018/11-5-specializing-in-javascript/index.md","title":"Specializing in JavaScript","description":"For the last few weeks I have taken a deep dive into the JavaScript programming language.

Users can vote as many times as she wants, again some lazy coding.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was more like a prototype of how the app would look and feel like.

So I put that backup and now my app it up!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Some thoughts after publishing it online:\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing it on localhost vs actual live deployment has day and night difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe app loads the posts after it publishes into the database, so this makes the app lose its react-ness. So in future work I will post the data to the state first, so when someone submits a post it gets displayed instantly and then sent to the database in the background.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site needs a loading indicator. Currently, the page stays dumb for a few seconds until all the post gets loaded.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I shared the site with the dev community, people started to spam the site. This is the first time I went to a headless approach. My backend gets data pushed to it via REST API\u2019s. I did not secure my API\u2019s this means anyone can send a request to it and manipulate the database. This + not having any validations led to a lot of post spam.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few days I dig into the code and added some validation mechanisms to the code.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Comments:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Christophe:** Hi Tamal,\\r\\nReading your awesome blogposts.\\r\\nI following the same way as you. Learning the basics from a lot of (web)languages (html,css,JS,php,perl,Sass,\u2026) and have experience with a lot of cms\u2019systems like processwire, Drupal, Get Simple CMS, GRAV CMS, \u2026 the last 3 years Building WP websites and do small theme and plugin development work.\\r\\nI\u2019m not an advanced programmer, but is difficult focus on one programming language.\\r\\nIn the feature i will try do a different thing and will do more developing webapps. So with this in mind, trying learn NodeJS the last weeks.\\r\\nSearching the internet about NodeJS articles, bought a book about NodeJS and looking a lot of NodeJS video\u2019s. At the moment i can build a (more advanced) \u2018hello world\u2019 app in NodeJS. I understand now what MEAN-stack is and other basic stuff. Explore the Express Generator and so on. But, there is a lot of work for me while developing like a pro. So i follow your blog with a lot of interest.

But the problem is, those sites are dumb, they don\u2019t do anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I wanted to make it more than a website, I needed to make it more dynamic. Like adding option for user registration. Give option to add content, comment on it. Do something with the input etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many years, I used WordPress to build basic dynamic websites. However WordPress is very limited to what you can do with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo turn a WordPress site into a social website, I had to install a lot of plugins and do a lot of theme modifications. At the end of the day, it\u2019s a hard thing to do, since WP was originally built to do one thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I knew, if I wanted to build a true web application, I had to go to the custom route.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Enter React\\r\\n\\r\\nReact is a user facing front end framework to build cool web pages/web applications. I fell in love with react because you can do something on the page and get the result without having to refresh the browser.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt can even process the data without you having to press a submit button, see:\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it turns out, with simple react I can just create a bunch of todo style apps.\\r\\n\\r\\nI realized that, react is not enough to build a full web application. It\u2019s just the front layout of the complete app.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Enter Node\\r\\n\\r\\nNode lets me make user registration option, ability to login, then submit content and all that cool stuff. I learned how to build a web app by building a simple Twitter clone app last season.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that article I mentioned, I am not fully satisfied the way it\u2019s turned out. It needs the reactness.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo this means I have to combine the magic of React with the power of Node.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Here Comes MERN\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a long lasting dream of mind to build a full stack app with Node in the backend and React on the front. I finally built a project called Reddit Clone, this time it\u2019s a MERN app.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long it took me? Roughly 6 months, from Node, then React and finally MERN stack.\\r\\n\\r\\nYeah baby, I am now a MERN stack developer.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what\u2019s next?\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\u2019s build more awesome stuff!!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Comments:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Navdeep Singh**: I can feel your excitement.

I went through some intro level stuff and I felt the same excitement the way I felt with intro level node stuff. The brain seeks new. There is a happiness trying to figure out something new.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I looked into a game developer building a game from scratch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I realized..\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pain of building something with C++ is no different than building with Node.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo matter what language or tech you choose, after going past the easy stuff, you will have to keep on grinding.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Short term Excitement vs long term Fulfillment\\r\\n\\r\\nI know Node, but that\u2019s just barely scratching the surface. There is so much more to learn about the Node runtime and JavaScript. If I just give it another chance, I can see what more is out there in this technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nYeah looking into a new language/tech can give me a small boost of excitement, but true happiness comes from building software that people really use and enjoy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Tamal, don\u2019t fall into the trap of seeking novelty in yet another shiny new thing.

This probably because I am using free web hosting from Heroku and a free tier database from mlab.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso for every request, I make (creating a tweet) the app reloads the page. All this makes the user experience laggy. I would call it the very early version of the original twitter site, and not a complete twitter clone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a while, all the profile pictures disappear. This is probably because Heroku does not allow image hosting. My app also has some security flaws which I have to learn and implement into the next projects.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy site is not mobile responsive either. I just wanted to put it up online as quickly as possible. From next time on, I will go with mobile-first approach.\\r\\n\\r\\n## After Twitter Clone\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter finishing the Node course (and the twitter clone) I took some break from Node.js. I went on and took another course for React.js. I spent some time learning React, as my end goal is to build web apps with the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React & Node)\\r\\n\\r\\nI spent a few weeks with React, building a few small apps. Then lately I reunited again with Node.js. This time I am building apps with Node and React combined.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea is to build the backend API with Node/Express and the front-facing user interface with React.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo this means if I refactor the twitter clone in React, then I will be able to make it respond faster (like realtime).\\r\\n\\r\\nI also need to learn more about test-driven development so I can make better apps.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Verdict\\r\\n\\r\\nSo looks like I am not happy with my creation, that\u2019s one reason it took me so much time to write about it. It\u2019s actually a positive thing, this means my expectations are much higher. I just have to work on honing my skills and keep on building.

I was learning Node.js to build the backend of my application. The first few lessons were about creating data, and then editing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn MongoDB mongoose, there are some handy commands for creating, editing items. Let\u2019s say I have a blog post which I created. To edit it, I call the `.findOneAndUpdate()` method for editing the existing collection.\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon figured out there must be a `.removeOne()` or `.deleteOne()` method to delete an item from the database collection.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave that a try.\\r\\n\\r\\n![deleting post](./images/1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nI created a controller to delete a collection, with some trial and error I was able to figure out the command for deleting a blog post is running the `.deleteOne()` method on my Blog object.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my router, I used a GET method for this delete option. Anytime I call the delete route, the post with that ID will be deleted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis week I am building a twitter clone with Node.js. Here I have a bunch of tweets posted by bunch of users.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow here\u2019s the problem, anyone can delete a tweet with the delete button, even the people who are not even logged in.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can type in the `Site.com/delete/5b16d5ac27542f10343e2717` and can manually delete any tweet from the database, because it\u2019s a `GET` request.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo fix this issue, I added a controller to check if the user is logged in to complete this action.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nrouter.get(\\r\\n  \'/delete/:id\',\\r\\n  authController.isLoggedIn,\\r\\n  tweetController.deleteTweet\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay, now only the logged in users can delete a tweet. But the problem was still there, anyone can delete any tweet.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I have to use a permission for deleting. Only allow the owner of that tweet to be able to delete it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI modeled this code after Wes Bos\u2019 LearnNode course. In video #29 he shows how to display the edit screen only to the owner of that store.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe code looks like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n![code](./images/3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nSo first I load up the store from the database and check for if the user actually owns the store. If the user owns the store, only then I will render the edit store page.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever this won\u2019t work with the delete action. You see if I call .deleteOne()\ufeff, then the tweet will be already deleted.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo instead I called the tweet first and then checked if the user owned that tweet.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nexports.deleteTweet = async (req, res) => {\\r\\n  try {\\r\\n    const tweet = await Tweet.findOne({ _id: req.params.id })\\r\\n    if (!req.user.username === \'tamal\') {\\r\\n      confirmedOwner(tweet, req.user)\\r\\n    }\\r\\n\\r\\n    const deleteTweet = await Tweet.deleteOne(tweet)\\r\\n    res.redirect(\'back\')\\r\\n  } catch (e) {\\r\\n    console.log(e)\\r\\n    res.redirect(\'/?msg=Failed to delete\')\\r\\n  }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce he/she is a verified owner, only then run the next command which is deleting the tweet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis made things bulletproof for now. Only the logged in users, who actually owned the tweet can delete it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final step was to only show the \u201cDelete\u201d link to the owner of that tweet.\\r\\n\\r\\n![delete link](./images/5.png)"},{"id":"things-i-learned-while-building-a-personal-project","metadata":{"permalink":"/tamalwebsite/things-i-learned-while-building-a-personal-project","editUrl":"https://github.com/tamalweb/tamalwebsite/tree/master/blog/2018/5-28-things-i-learned-while-building-a-personal-project/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2018/5-28-things-i-learned-while-building-a-personal-project/index.md","title":"Things I Learned While Building a Personal Project","description":"Last week I ran into a real world problem.","date":"2018-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 28, 2018","tags":[{"label":"javascript","permalink":"/tamalwebsite/tags/javascript"},{"label":"project","permalink":"/tamalwebsite/tags/project"}],"readingTime":4.4,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Tamal Web","title":"Frontend Engineer, author of this blog","url":"/about","imageURL":"/img/tamalweb.jpg","key":"tamalweb"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Deleting an Item From MongoDB Mongoose By User Permission","permalink":"/tamalwebsite/deleting-an-item-from-mongodb-mongoose-by-user-permission"},"nextItem":{"title":"Quitting is important","permalink":"/tamalwebsite/quitting-is-important"}},"content":"Last week I ran into a real world problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s hard to keep track of my washed and dirty clothes. I have no idea how long it\u2019s been since last wash. So I needed to track them by making a list and counting the dates.\\r\\n\\r\\n![laundry list](./images/1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first idea is obviously writing them down on paper, but then I thought why not use my JavaScript skills to build an app to track it?\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## The initial idea:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s a one page app with a To-Do list kind of functionality. I want to be able to add and remove items. In this context, my items are the clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also want to add a date into that clothe and count how many days have been passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoing a quick google search revealed that there is a Date object in JavaScript which I can tap into.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo for every clothe, I attached the current date into it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI created an array of objects. Each object being the item of clothing that has an item text and a date field.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nconst sampleData = [\\r\\n  { text: \'Sample Item\', date: \'2018-05-21T14:53:18.883Z\', done: false },\\r\\n  { text: \'Another Sample\', date: \'2018-05-21T14:53:26.899Z\', done: false },\\r\\n]\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nFor now I just need these two things.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Tracking how many days passed\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my mind I thought I had to do some calculations and save the new data in a new field for how many days passed. Then I remembered, there is a cool library called Moment.js.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I put the date into the moment function, it will show a nice little relative time like **2 days ago** or **7 days from now.**\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I quickly implemented momentjs into my application. This saved me a lot of work trying to calculate the relative days.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Saving the data\\r\\n\\r\\nSo for an application like this, the data has to be stored somewhere. I can\u2019t just open the app, add items and when I refresh the page it\u2019s all gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know how to add data into database, but for that I will need to make it into a Node.js app with MongoDB and specialized web hosting. It\u2019s just a side project, I don\u2019t want to go in all the trouble for this.\\r\\n\\r\\nI searched online and found there is an api called localStorage.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo with localStorage you can save some text data into a user\u2019s browser.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is just the thing I need for my app. So I went ahead and look into ways to implement it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo when I add items into my list, it will be stored in my web browser as local storage.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Making it work\\r\\n\\r\\nI coded the basic implementation of the app, but I was running into problems. The main problem I faced was, I created a variable called \u201citems\u201d and this variable contained the array of objects. The object was grabbed from the local storage.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nconst items = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(\'items\'))\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when you open the app for the first time, there is no local storage and no data in that variable, this led to huge problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found Wes Bos had a [dedicated video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL1F4dCUlLc) on localStorage api. I looked into the tutorial and it helped a lot to build out my app. His walkthrough helped build this app in a much more efficient way.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo to solve my initial problem, I set my items variable to the data found from localStorage. But when there is no local storage, it will fall back to an empty array [ ].\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nconst items = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(\'items\')) || []\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Designing the frontend & putting it all together\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter my app was working as I wanted, I went on to my favorite part: the design. I worked a few hours to come up with a sleek user interface.\\r\\n\\r\\nI built the items into an ordered list, so they come with numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did some CSS work to make the app look pretty.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Making it general purpose\\r\\n\\r\\nI built this glorified ToDo list to track my laundry, but not everyone will be using it for the same purpose. So I went ahead and made it more \u201cgeneral\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nI made the title into something which the user can change.\\r\\n\\r\\n![change the title](./images/2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nI made the title into a form field and when the user clicks on it, he/she can change it to something else.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also made the website title tag into the title of the app and also saved it into local storage.\\r\\n\\r\\n![website title tag](./images/3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nI did it by setting the document.title property to my variable:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// 1. Getting the title from local storage OR fallback to default title\\r\\nlet title = localStorage.getItem(\'localTitle\') || \'Laundry List \u270e Edit this!\'\\r\\n// 2. Getting the title from the form\\r\\ndocument.querySelector(\'[name=title]\').value = title\\r\\n// 3. Setting the document title tag\\r\\ndocument.title = title\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Final thoughts\\r\\n\\r\\nI had fun working on this little thing. It\u2019s really useful too! I am using it to properly track my laundry.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am also going to work on a portable mobile version, so people can use it offline and in mobile too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis little side project taught me so many new things.

To get the most done, you must quit many things. You must quit projects, say \u201c**NO**\u201d to things, so you can succeed at your goals.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are always being reminded not to quit, just go for it, just do it. Any motivational seminar, video or quote tells us to never quit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut does this kind of motivation really works?\\r\\n\\r\\n**It doesn\u2019t, here\u2019s why:**\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nI was your average highly motivated productive person. I would get done many things, and I was really proud of myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was admired by people around me, because of how much work I do.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I had this one flaw:\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not say \u201cNO\u201d to anything. Just like you, I get new ideas everyweek to do something new. I would get pitched a new idea, a new joint venture on a regular basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result I was doing a dozen of things all at once.\\r\\nIt created an illusion that I was getting so much done, and I am super busy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if I examine the individual projects, I would see a bunch of half-baked things.\\r\\nThings that are sucking my time.\\r\\n\\r\\n## I Quit!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moment of realization came when I read the book The Dip from Seth Godin. All my life I was told you should never quit. But this book taught me, you should quit. You should quit early.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinishing the book, I started to rearrange my work life. I knew I had to quit everything I am doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be successful, you must quit every other thing and focus on just one thing only. When you are focused with that one thing, only then you will get the true success out of it.\\r\\nThe motivational advice comes handy then: don\u2019t quit, keep going, just do it the thing you decided to work on.\\r\\nSeth taught me to quit. Quit early, quit often. But once you have already into it deep, you are in the dip, don\u2019t quit.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Saying No.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo is my new best friend. I am saying \u201cNO\u201d to almost everything that comes to me. New ideas, new ventures, new partnerships, new offers, I turn down everything. First I must complete my current goal at hand, and once I am fully satisfied with the progress, only then I will accept something else.\\r\\nThis helped me to work on just a few things, as oppose to doing 10 different things at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\n## A Gift From The Past\\r\\n\\r\\nQuitting is not easy. Especially when you have spent so much time and energy into something.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can you quit something, that you put many years into?\\r\\nSeth Godin recieved a similar question and his answer helped me very much. It goes something like this, better explained in this video from (Break the Twitch):\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine your past self gifted you something. Now you don\u2019t have any space left in your closet to put that in. If you just get rid of the gift, you can make room for new stuff. You must treat that as a gift from your past self and remove it just as you would do with any old tangible good.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPZLVEjCRh8\\r\\n\\r\\n## Don\u2019t Quit Emotionally, Make a Plan\\r\\n\\r\\nMaking emotional decisions can cost you a lot. Instead make a plan. Just give yourself some time and conditions.\\r\\nWrite down in paper: If I don\u2019t get X amount of return within Y amount of time, I will quit this thing.\\r\\nGive it some reasonable timeframe like 6-12 months and a reasonable outcome. What happens when you meet the goal? Make another timeframe. This will definitely help you keep the projects that work for you and get rid of the ones that are pulling you down.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of quiting is horrible, embarrassing, and scary. It makes you look like a looser to other people. But if you quit properly, you will be left with only the things that matter to you most.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Comments:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Shamim**: I still remember the days when I was doing a job in BJMC and later created a company in Dhaka. My friends were running the company but I felt i need to quit. So, I quit from BJMC and got busy with SEO & Internet Marketing stuff. \ud83d\ude09\\r\\n\\r\\n> You quit your govt job.

It was about time I build something with my knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time I didn\u2019t know what actually JQuery was. I thought it\u2019s another language like JS. Now I know well that, JQuery is a library which goes on top of JavaScript. It makes writing code a little bit easier.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn overview of what I am going to build:\\r\\n\\r\\n![bkash calc](./images/1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a mobile payment service in Bangladesh called Bkash. You can use the service to pay friends. They charge a % for every time you want to cash out from your wallet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea was simple,\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Have a text field so people can input an amount\\r\\n2. Click on the button to calculate the result\\r\\n3. The fee amount will show up\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not sleep the previous night. So I got up to my computer with enthusiasm. I built the logic first.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile trying to work on it, I learned the hard way: following a tutorial is easy but building something on my own doesn\u2019t always behave the same way.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The JavaScript\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at my code, I rush coded a lot. I did not comment on the code, I didn\u2019t even use semantic variable names.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nvar $b = $(\'input[name=bkashamount]\').val()\\r\\nvar $c = $cashout()\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nVariable `$b` should have been called `balance`.\\r\\n\\r\\n`$c` should have been `change`.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also didn\u2019t add a class or ID for the input button text, which would\u2019ve to make my life a bit more easier.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo you see all the code is a mess and harder to follow through.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conditional logic tree was the hardest part.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took me more than an hour to create a simple calculation to work. At the time of building the calculator, Bkash had a different fee structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir fee % varies on the amount you are cashing out.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Bkash old fee structure](./images/2.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I had to write a long set of conditions to fit the fee structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a really long (6-8) steps of else if codes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a nightmare to make this work. So after I was done, I could display both a smaller amount and a larger amount with the correct fee.\\r\\n\\r\\n## New Fee Structure\\r\\n\\r\\nRight after I implemented the cumbersome fee, I did a lookup online and found that Bkash now has a simplified fee structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat you know, they now have 1.85% flat fee for any amount you wanna cash out.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Are you kidding me?](./images/3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had known this earlier, it would have saved me a lot of trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyways, I implemented the new fee structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few tweaks and checking my code part was ready.\\r\\n\\r\\n## HTML Page\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site has just a single HTML page for the view. It was the first time I coded a page without the help of the Bootstrap framework. At the time I did not know how to create a container in the middle so I used a table markup.\\r\\n\\r\\n```html\\r\\n<table>\\r\\n\\t\\t<thead>\\r\\n\\t\\t</thead>\\r\\n\\t\\t<tbody>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<td><h1><a href=\\"/\\"><img src=\\"images/logo.png\\"/></a></h1></td>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<td><iframe src=\\"//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=https://tamalanwar.github.io/bkash-calc/%2F&amp;width&amp;layout=button_count&amp;action=like&amp;show_faces=false&amp;share=true&amp;height=21&amp;appId=114661981960459\\" scrolling=\\"no\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" style=\\"border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;\\" allowTransparency=\\"true\\"></iframe></td>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</tr>\\r\\n\\t\\t</tbody>\\r\\n\\t</table>\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nA table really?\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, I also invented a new HTML tag called the `<wrapper>` wow!\\r\\n\\r\\nOther than these rookie mistakes, the final design was good. It also had Facebook open graph tags which looked nice when I shared on social media.\\r\\n\\r\\n![A simple Bkash fee calculator](./images/4.jpg)\\r\\nI also registered a free domain name BkashCalc.tk to host it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was happy and proud to share my work. Overall it was a good first project.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can have a look at the working version here and the source code on Github.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince then I made a new Bkash calculator with React:\\r\\n\\r\\n![new calculator](./images/5.gif)\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\u2019t have the live version up but you can have a look at the source code.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Comments:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Morol**: I still remember the days when you first launched this app. \ud83d\ude42\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this has been a pure roasting. \ud83d\ude42\\r\\n\\r\\n> Tamal: Thank you for following me from those days buddy! One thing I regret is, there has been a huge gap from those days to recent times. I wish I stick with just one path.\\r\\n> Ohh yeah, I am thinking about roasting my own stuff from now on, whenever I can feel creative.

We were introduced to a new era. After the launch, every other phones were just a copy of the iphone. But I am not here to talk about the technological revolution of the smartphone industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to discuss the lessons I learned from Apple\u2019s iPhone from a product development perspective.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Start Simple\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you look at the original iPhone, you would realize how lame that phone was. It didn\u2019t had video recording option, no 3G, and many modern features you would expect from a new phone.\\r\\n\\r\\n![apple vs nokia smartphone](./images/1.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nApple could have put so many things into the iPhone and make it a killer feature rich smartphone, but they went for the simple route.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore feature means more research and development time. Steve Jobs and his team brought the minimum viable product to the market and see the reaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough it lacked many essential features of a modern phone that time, it did just a few things right.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the iPhone, its wow factor was the full screen touch screen, rotating screen, iPod, internet and messaging features.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Sell on The Benefits\\r\\n\\r\\nSteve Jobs talked about the user interface and how it is built for day to day situations. He got rid of the stylus in favor of finger touch. He scrolled down the contact list, the music library to show how easy it is to scroll through the long list of items with a touchscreen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMessages were modern and looks like modern messaging apps. You need to swipe to unlock the screen so that it does not accidentally unlocks in your pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe didn\u2019t sold on how much ram or processing power the phone has, all he did was show what the iPhone can do.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Add Another Feature in Your Next Version\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next iPhone had some extra features like video recording, 3G and faster speed. They could have included it on the first iphone but they didn\u2019t. They made it into a second version just so they can sell more units.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\u2019t like that companies making products that don\u2019t last longer. To increase the profits they launch a new product every year with slightly more features than before and drop support for the older ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the first iPhone, Apple kept launching one/two new iPhones every year with slightly better features. So please take note, if you want to increase your profit margins, launch new versions of the same product to sell more and more copies.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Applying Steve Jobs\u2019 Formula on My Own:\\r\\n\\r\\nFew years ago I learnt about WordPress theme development and I was so hooked up to create my own themes. For my first theme to the public, I thought of going the easy way by creating a free theme. This way, the expectations would be low.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I applied Steve Jobs\u2019 iPhone formulla, by stripping out all the modern features of that theme and just go with a simple presentable theme.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was still learning at the moment and implementing many features would increase the development time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I created version 1.0 of that theme with some basic features.\\r\\n\\r\\n![blogkori theme](./images/2.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme was so simple with nothing more than just regular WordPress features, like custom header, background image, background color etc. These are default features which come with WordPress.\\r\\n\\r\\n**My finished version was pretty plain.**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first theme had this default blue color scheme which you can\u2019t even change from the options.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ignored what my theme doesn\u2019t have and used what I have:\\r\\n\\r\\nI talked about the benefits of using the theme like\\r\\n\\r\\n- Having a good typography keeps the reader engaged\\r\\n- Simple site loads faster\\r\\n- The code has HTML5 semantic markup for better search rankings etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo anyways I put the theme out to the public. A few people tried it out and started to use it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI added a few more code improvements and submit the theme to WordPress theme directory. After it was approved, I saw lots of downloads.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople loved my free theme. More than 1,000 people are using the theme. Every now and then I get message from people who are using and loving the theme.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt motivated me and got me to work on the theme again.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the next version I added Google Analytics options, then followed by color scheme option.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou see, I did not wasted my time trying to make my product filled with lots of cool features. I stick to the essentials, get it out to the public and talked about the benefits.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can learn a lot by following Steve Jobs and Apple products. Just watching one video how Steve launches a new product can teach you a lot about selling technology to the masses.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGoM_wVrwng\\r\\n\\r\\nTo sum it all up:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Create a minimum viable product (MVP) and get it out to the public for feedback\\r\\n2. Add more features as you go on with next iterations\\r\\n3. Talk about the benefits, not the features\\r\\n\\r\\n## Comments:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Ryan Biddulph:** Good analogy Tamal! Simple wins. Every time. Simple, clear, basic, all are winning elements in the product development game. This is why all of my eBooks, courses and audio books are simple. The ultimate lesson in life is to keep things basic, to remove the complex, and folks doing this become icons. You are on your way brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nRyan\\r\\n\\r\\n> Tamal: Good to see you here buddy! Yes, simple rocks!"},{"id":"i-never-thought-i-would-become-a-programmer-one-day","metadata":{"permalink":"/tamalwebsite/i-never-thought-i-would-become-a-programmer-one-day","editUrl":"https://github.com/tamalweb/tamalwebsite/tree/master/blog/2018/4-12-i-never-thought-i-would-become-a-programmer-one-day/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2018/4-12-i-never-thought-i-would-become-a-programmer-one-day/index.md","title":"I Never Thought I Would Become A Programmer One Day","description":"Growing up I was just a regular boy.

I was never good at science or maths. I like to break things apart, but I wont call myself a tech nerd. So how did a regular guy like me turn into a programmer, coding things from scratch?\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\u2019s be honest here, programming is not that easy. It takes discipline and repeated effort to code something on your own, build a thing which actually works. I never thought someday I would turn into a web developer and actually code in this weird language.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note: I am using the words \u201ccoding\u201d, \u201cdevelopment\u201d, and \u201cprogramming\u201d interchangeably in this article, although they all have very different meanings. But you get the point!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I get the chance to talk to people who are new to code, it reminds me how it felt when I was just starting out.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time ago, I met this guy at a conference. It was not a developer conference, it was more like a marketing one. While talking with him, he learned about my web development work and how I became a self taught web developer.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnowing that, he expressed to me that he can never ever learn to code:\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cYou know Tamal bro, I can never learn how to code. I just don\u2019t get it!\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo instead of comforting him by saying how everyone can code, how easy it is and all that, I told him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cYou are right, you won\u2019t get it. I was just like you many years ago when I just couldn\u2019t understand all the code.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cHTML code looked like Chinese text to me.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cAll I did was just copy and paste bunch of codes and put it all together.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cBut as I built many websites, I slowly started to get it.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHearing my words gave him comfort, and I think after that day he will see programming in a different light.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got started into building websites, I came across all the free resources like blogs, tutorials and W3Schools. But I didn\u2019t even had the skill to read and learn from the documentation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor me it took a while to condition myself into a programming mindset to finally understand how to code things.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt didn\u2019t happen magically just by watching a few tutorial videos or completing a course. The real journey was different. To help you track how I got so far, here is a quick highlight of my learning over the years:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Early days**: I used website builders and MS FrontPage to build websites. Used Flash to create interfaces.\\r\\n- **Blogger/blogspot days**: Copy pasted code from various places to design sites.\\r\\n- **WordPress days**: Used little HTML & PHP code to change various design elements. Once again, I copy pasted from the web.\\r\\n- **Thesis theme days**: I used the Thesis Theme to build designs. Learned little CSS to customize the websites but most of it was copy-pasta.\\r\\n- **Codecademy**: Took my first formal programming lesson with the Hour of Code. Took formal lessons on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and PHP from Codecademy. Built my first \u201cThing\u201d with JS.\\r\\n- **WordPress themes**: Built my first WordPress theme and got it approved to the theme directory. This is when I started to call myself a real web developer.\\r\\n- **Modern times**: I made my mind to pursue a career in web development/programming. I am learning how to build web applications with Node.js and JavaScript.\\r\\n- **In 2019**: I am studying to become a software engineer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you can see, I spent a long time just copy and pasting bunch of code from the internet.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking formal courses gave me a bird eye view over the subject but it did not instantly turned me into a pro. It took repeated effort and practice to master various things.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I see my learning curve is getting shorter. I am learning new technology faster as I practice more.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo if there is anything you can take from my story: everyone learns differently. If you want to do this kind of thing, give it a shot. If you really love to program, you will learn it eventually (no matter how long it takes).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Comments\\r\\n\\r\\n**DJ Rony:** There is no shortcut or easy way, only the hard way. All the best brother.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Tamal: Good to see you here DJ! Yes that\u2019s true, there\u2019s no shortcut.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Oksana:** Well done !! It\u2019s a proof that only hard persistent work, grinding and patience can lead to success! Go for it!\\r\\n\\r\\n> Tamal: Thanks for dropping by Oksana, all the best to your code learning!"}]}')}}]);
