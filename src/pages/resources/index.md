### Recommended JavaScript course:

Brush up your JavaScript skills with Mosh Hemedani, he teaches slowly and makes everything simple:

- [JavaScript Basics for Beginners from Udemy](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=cQpm*Xe*riM&mid=39197&u1=resources&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fjavascript-basics-for-beginners%2F)

### Recommended React JS Ebook:

- [Pure React](https://www.purereact.com/)

This was the ebook that finally taught me what React is all about. It is for people from non-technical backgrounds.

### Recommended Node JS courses:

Another course from Mosh is a must when learning about Node JS. It’s two years old but I included it for the quality of the teaching.

- [Node.js the Complete Guide](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=cQpm*Xe*riM&mid=39197&u1=resources&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fnodejs-master-class%2F)

:::warning A note on courses
You don't have to watch a course from start to finish, and you also don't have to feel bad about it. The best way to learn from courses is to pick a topic you like and learn it from the course + outside sources like blogs and YouTube videos.
