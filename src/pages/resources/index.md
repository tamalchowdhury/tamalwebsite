### Recommended JavaScript course:

Brush up your JavaScript skills with Mosh Hemedani, he teaches slowly and makes everything simple:

[JavaScript Basics for Beginners from Udemy](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=cQpm*Xe*riM&mid=39197&u1=resources&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fjavascript-basics-for-beginners%2F)

### Recommended Node JS courses:

Another course from Mosh is a must when learning about Node JS. It’s two years old but I included it for the quality of the teaching.

:::warning A note on courses
You don't have to watch a course from start to finish, and you also don't have to feel bad about it. The best way to learn from courses is to pick a topic you like and learn it from the course + outside sources like blogs and YouTube videos.

## Software and Productivity

**Code Editor**: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), after switching to it, I can’t say enough about this code editor. In the past I used Atom editor.

**Basic Photo editing** (for Windows): [PhotoScape](http://www.photoscape.org/ps/main/download.php), handy for quick cropping, resizing, batch processing.

## Online Presence:

**Shared Web Hosting**: [BlueHost](https://bit.ly/PickBluehost), for hosting your professional website on the internet.

**WordPress**: For quickly setting up a personal or professional blog or website on your shared web hosting account. Can be done with a **one-click installe**r from any modern web host.

**Premium WordPress Theme Builder**: [Divi Theme Builder](https://bit.ly/GetDiviTheme), it lets you drag and drop elements and build your own design. Good for non-coders out there who want to make a cool design within a few hours. It's a good prototyping tool.

## WordPress plugins:
