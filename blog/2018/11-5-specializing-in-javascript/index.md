For the last few weeks I have taken a deep dive into the JavaScript programming language. Earlier this year I decided to work with Node.js so that I can work on just one language for the front end and the back.

I am now going in deep with JS. It’s fun.

I am following this collection of [33 Concepts in JS](https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts) which is really helping me a LOT. I am tackling about one concept a day. One thing leads to another and I am spending most of my YouTube hours watching JS related videos and reading articles.

Staying focused in one language is helping me learn it quicker and soon I will become a master of it.

It’s not very easy to focus you know, every week I think about checking out another language. Languages like Go, Python, Kotlin, teases me in my YouTube feed.

There are some weird parts of JavaScript, which sometimes turn me off, but then again when I learn a new concept I get back up at it. I am glad I did not quit Node.js when I was getting bored with it.

As I mentioned before, I am not a big fan of JavaScript and predict it will be replaced in the near future. But until that time comes up (maybe in 5-10 years) why not be really good at it while it’s thriving?
