As funny and absurd as it sounds, I think it‚Äôs a similar feeling. I chased node, I tried to figure it out. I dreamt of building stuff with node. Eventually I figure it out. I learned how to build stuff with it. Then slowly I got bored with it. Looks like the honeymoon period is over üôÅ

This is actually an interesting take on learning code.

And this also happened with me when learning other languages!

<!-- truncate -->

If you read my other stuff, you will know that I went from one language to another to finally settle down with JavaScript.

For the other languages that I tried, Java, Python, PHP and Ruby, I didn‚Äôt got to build anything with them. I could not fully understand those tech and kinda lost interest.

Now with Node, the same thing happened in the beginning, but I said to myself, if I quit now, I will feel the same with yet another language down the road.

So I went with it anyway and got passed the hard learning curve.

Now recently I am fairly proficient with Node.js and all it takes for me is to put some work to build an application.

But the process kinda bores me.

I looked into other novelty, like another computer language.

## Looking into C, C++ Tutorials

So last evening I went online and look into some C and C++ tutorials. I went through some intro level stuff and I felt the same excitement the way I felt with intro level node stuff. The brain seeks new. There is a happiness trying to figure out something new.

Then I looked into a game developer building a game from scratch.

Then I realized..

The pain of building something with C++ is no different than building with Node.

No matter what language or tech you choose, after going past the easy stuff, you will have to keep on grinding.

## Short term Excitement vs long term Fulfillment

I know Node, but that‚Äôs just barely scratching the surface. There is so much more to learn about the Node runtime and JavaScript. If I just give it another chance, I can see what more is out there in this technology.

Yeah looking into a new language/tech can give me a small boost of excitement, but true happiness comes from building software that people really use and enjoy.

So Tamal, don‚Äôt fall into the trap of seeking novelty in yet another shiny new thing. Stick to Node + JavaScript until you fully master it.

I‚Äôm sure you won‚Äôt regret it!
